# Sentiment Analysis - First steps
This project is a personnal one I decided to work on during my first internship. 

After one year in discovering data science with an introduction to Machine Learning algorithms in 2018/2019, I wanted to work on how to bring business insights thanks to techniques I had briefly studied. Thus I decided to study first steps of Natural Language Processing without prior knowledge through a sentiment analysis of online reviews in order to understand effitiently customers' pain points. As it is a discovery of NLP, this only contains the basis I worked on on my personal time. 

Thanks to the Master 2 Data Science and my third engineering year in 2020/2021 I had the opportunity to study NLP in greater details.
