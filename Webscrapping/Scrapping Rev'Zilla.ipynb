      "I bought this helmet after I returned my Shoe GT-Air because of fitting issues. I was hoping for similar features to the Shoei but it doesn't quite meet the same level of quality in my opinion. Visor: The lever to use the drop down visor feels a little cheap and doesn't move with ease. I spent a decent amount of time while riding to find the lever to pull it back, it can be a little difficult with gloves on. Another complaint is that it doesn't go fully into the helmet, it peaks out just enough for me to notice it in my peripheral vision. Wind noise: It could be quieter but it does a decent job. Fogging: Definitely not fog proof. I was hoping to have a major upgrade from my baseline HJC but it's not all that much better. Fit: I was super happy with the fitting on this. If you have a round head-shape and want a drop down at a low cost then this is a good helmet for you.Overall it's a decent helmet, especially for the price.\n",

      "I recently came from a shoei rf-sr and I prefer this helmet a lot more. I find that it fits snug in my head without being too tight. I'm also able to wear my glasses without any struggle which is hard to find. It comes with cut outs for a communication system(I use a cardo packtalk) that are slightly small for my speakers but with a little wiggling work just fine. The wind noise isn't too much but it is definitely there, but it is expected out of a high airflow helmet. I use the chrome visor and it does scratch kinda easily but nothing too big to notice but it being around $80 does suck. The drop down visor goes over my glasses with ease. I find the padding to be better than the shoei rf-sr but that might just be personal preference. It is definitely an excellent helmet for the price and looks good as well.\n",

      "I give 4 stars because the video say it's more of an intermediate oval. It's not. It's a round oval helmet. To fix this I had to smush the foam inside the helmet down with my thumb in certain areas and then it fit perfectly. As far as quiet goes, it's quiet enough with all the vents closed except the very top vent to have a very clear conversation on both sides at 80 mph on the freeway and on a naked bike. With the top vent the only vent open on the helmet in 90* weather, this helmet provides more than enough air flow to be comfortable. The sun shade switch could be a little more hefty. But feels just strong enough to do it's job. I feel like I'm gonna break it every time I use it. But it works every time and hasn't broke.Overall an awesome helmet. Especially considering the price and the 4 star SHARP rating. Can't beat it.\n",

      "I bought the Rossi Tartuga edition based on looks and brand and price. I did not want to spend the $1,600 on a Pista R so I figured this would still be good but come with nice style. It definitely has style! Colors are bright and has the aggressive look. Pairs nicely with the blue indium shield!I can't say anything about protection since I never went down on it, but durability is pretty good, about what you can expect for a $250 helmet.Features that are nice is the cracked shield position, this helps a lot with airflow. Especially since it fogs up veryy easily -- big downside for me. It does have a drop down sunvisor and everyone comments about how awesome it is...but honestly it's dumb. I never wear sunglasses and almost always have the blue indium shield on which works perfectly fine. But the visor obstructs the view as it does not go all the way up in the forehead lid, just a little portion hangs down but enough to get in my top line of sight. Also unnecessary weight and simply looks awful.Comfort is nice, weight is not too bad. Rode +600 miles in one trip with it on my 17' R6, never had an issue with neck soreness.The field of view from a side-to-side standpoint is solid, no issues. But I have an issue the up-to-down view point. It's almost like it's always slightly short for when I'm looking up and have to tilt my neck back even further to see more properly farther up ahead. A bit annoying.Overall though its a decent helmet. Its a cheap helmet so you get what you pay for. I wanted an AGV, great style, and Rossi replica. I got all of that with this. It was not until I really wore the helmet +5k miles so far have I realized I would rather upgrade (at least to the Corsa...but unfortunately not as many Rossi replicas in that style that I like). So if you're on a budget, want a good looking helmet, that works decent, I'd recommend it. If you want an awesome helmet with no complaints..this isn't the one.\n",

      "So I've have my eye on this helmet for a while, the style and brand is what initially got my interested so after a while I decided to buy it. And after receiving it i was very happy, it comes with little notched clips to add some variety to where your visor sits which I thought was cool and once i put it on it fit like a glove. I had no problem with the drop down visor a lot of people seem to have, I guess I'm lucky. Now my only problem with the helmet came when It was time to take it off. As i was pulling it off some plastic or rough stitching wedged itself against my ears and while the first time didnt hurt, multiple times a day over a week the pain become a real problem. I dont know if it's I have big ears or what but it seems to just be me. I was able to solve the problem with a felt tape I happen to have from my job and it mostly remedies the problem but it still hurts a tad. Over all I still love the helmet and will keep it but if you've got bigger ears be wary, I was lucky to have my felt tape on hand and if you can't find a way to smooth out the stitching on the padding you're going to have a rough time getting the helmet off.\n",

Easy to remove all padding to wash.Air flow is magnificent with this helmet.It flows ton of air through the helmet to keep me cool and dry. The sun visor can be darker, but it is adequate. It is handy when you don't have your sunglasses with you. I would still prefer to wear my sunglasses; which it fits fine with this helmet. The weight is average, I am not getting sore neck after hour riding. And it does not give me too much pressure with head turns on highway speed.The vision from this helmet is wide that I can have the full view.The wind noise is tolerable; but I will still use earplugs.

Super wide range of vision which I loved. The anti for coating was gone after about 300 miles or so. Great in the rain. The extended chin looks dope and totally helped in my accident.

I only read online that it was noisy after i purchased.Why isn't my review sucky then? Well, I think this helmet is stylish, and functional with the features I wanted (matte black, on the mid-range price, has a sun visor that flips down) and has a sporty look that I'm going for.

My big issue is the foam on the cheek pads is very moldable, which is nice, however, after 3 months of riding the foam on the cheek pads have warped. This is due to hanging my helmet from the helmet lock while bike is parked. To be clear, I only did this during the day while I was at work. With the foam warped, the helmet is loud.  My other complaint is the design of the helmet makes it look huge on your head.\n",

      "I am a new rider, and this is my first helmet, so I don't have anything else to reference too. Besides that I went to a local shop and tried this on, along with the Bell DLX, I preferred the fit and finish of the AVG over the Bell. So i went with it. Put 300 miles on my bike so far with this helmet, in the VA summer heat 80 to 90 degrees. I am staying comfortable with the great airflow in this helmet, I found the internal visor useless for me, as others have stated it needs to come down farther to be a practical feature. Also, with it up in the helmet, i could see the bottom of the internal visor hanging down, so i took the thing out. I have been wearing sunglasses and using the clear shield, which is working great. At some point i will throw down the $70+ on a smoke or iridium shield. The helmet is very comfortable in terms of the padding, was a little harsh at first but it has broken in around the face and is nice and soft. The weight doesn't seem to be an issue, i feel like the ergonomics of the helmet help in cutting through the wind at speed. I have used earplugs when I know i'll be at any speed over 50 mph, the wind noise is pretty loud, but then again i have no frame of reference as to what loud is. Earplugs are very easy and cheap, do not mind using them at all! Again from my beginner experience, this was the best helmet at this price range, and i am very happy with it. Helmet is Matte Black with the white AVG logo. I wish I had the italia AVG logos like some others have received.\n",

I ride a Panigale 899 so my body position is more aggressive than most, when I'm fully tucked I can BARELY see what's in front of me. I literally have to push my helmet up a bit or awkwardly lift my head up to see better.

I find the internal visor to be a perfect shade, not too light, not too dark and very convenient. I'm a size large in every helmet I've ever worn, Shoei, Arai, and Bell. Size large in this fit me like a glove. Yes I did own $700 dollar helmets in the past, but that was when I was young and living with my parents with no other bills to pay. Honestly I don't feel any difference in any aspect between this and any top end helmet I've owned. Although it is only DOT certified whereas most higher end helmets are usually Snell.Ventilation is good for this price. As far as noise, I actually find it to be somewhat quiet, contrary to other reviews. I got the matt black, looks great. Highly recommend.\n",

      "Great helmet! Beautiful design! Agresive!\n",
      "I am a huge fan of AGV helmets, the comfort, style, design and features are #1 in my opinion.  I love plain helmets (no graphics) matte black, and aggressive designs so the AGV K3 SV was the helmet.  I admit I didn't care about the flip down sun visor but like the looks over the regular K3.  Infact this helmet is so different from the regular K3 it really should have a different model number.  Fit and comfort are amazing! I also ordered the smoke shield which really finishes this helmet off!  Also you can't beat Revzilla for any product.  Best service, prices, and customer service anywhere!!!! 100% win on this order!\n",

      "This is a very well made helmet. I have had mine for several months now and it offers quite a few features without lightening the wallet too much. As far as comfort goes, it's very enjoyable to wear for an entire day of riding. The vents move an awful lot of air keeping my head nice and cool. The drop-down sun visor is a huge plus as I don't have to keep another visor on hand when it gets bright. I do wish a pinlock visor would come with the helmet. The anti-fog coating doesn't last incredibly long so i am using anti-fog solution for my scuba goggles. I would gladly pay a little extra to have a pinlock ready visor come in the box. It would be nice to have slightly deeper cutouts for a headset. I currently have the Sena 10R installed and the speakers press slightly against my ears. I would also like to have the option to get a slightly thicker neck roll to help quiet down the wind noise a little. But I solve that by wearing ear plugs anyway so it's not that big a deal. All in all, I'd buy this helmet again. The bang for buck factor is definitely high.\n",

      "TL;DR: If you're looking for a good value helmet and it fits your head, check this out. There are a lot of helmet options out there, but I settled on this for the combination of features, protection, comfort and price. After consulting the UK's helmet safety scheme listing for this, I was sold. Lightweight, well-ventilated, durable/protective (according to the UK government), comfortable and has an integrated sun visor? Count me in. I had never ordered a helmet before-- always tried them on in-person, so top marks to the poor RevZilla gear geek who walked me through the whole thing. It fit absolutely perfectly-- comfortably- neither loose, nor squeezy tight-- even with my glasses.  The weight is not bad-- I do a lot of long distance touring and I'm yet to experience neck fatigue from the helmet. It's not carbon fiber, but it's also a sub-$250 helmet, so what do you expect?Airflow is more than adequate in both upright and slight-tucked positions. Three upper front vents and a chin vent move plenty of air to keep my brain from cooking. While I recommend hearing protection while riding, I found the K3SV to be rather quiet, especially when compared against my old Icon.The snap-out liner makes for easy clean-up if you sweat your brains out in traffic.The integrated sunvisor is sufficient and was worth the difference in price between the K3 and K3SV. No, it isn't like a 90% pair of sunglasses, but for something to cut the glare down, I've found it to be effective. It also doesn't interfere with my glasses.The speaker recesses in the foam also fit the thin/shallow speakers Sena 20S speakers. AGV has their own bluetooth unit, but it was more expensive than the much-vaunted Sena units, so I went with that. Overall, a great helmet. For the price, I couldn't find anything better.\n",

      "For 200$ you are getting a great deal here. The manufacturer is well known, the look is great, and it has features many riders look for.The airflow is great, as well as the airvents adding to the aesthetics of the helmet. The internal visor works very smoothly, it is adjusted with a small switch on the left side of the helmet. The visor looks great, the only short coming is the tint is not particularly dark. The external visor has multiple locking settings, which I don't personally care about but it's a nice addition. It's got a great look to it, it's a lighter helmet, it's comfortable, has good basic features. It's the ideal helmet without going over the top, in luxury or price.\n",

      "Bought this helmet based on the video review on RZ. Took awhile to ship since it came from Los Vegas and I'm in Philly, but I made due with an old open face helmet until it arrived. Order the gloss black. Fit is true to size. I feel like a badass with the silver face shield. Noise level could be better. When I turn my head I get a bit of whistling from the seal of the face shield. Tends to fog up, too on very cold mornings. Don't know if that's the helmet, or if that's typical. Regardless, a comfortable and sleek looking helmet that isn't going to break the bank.\n",

      "Ownership:6 months.Relative Specification:My Int. Oval Circumference is 22.5 in or 57.15 cm, and MS (medium-small) size at 57 cm fits me perfectly.The two biggest ups for the AGV K3 SV are its feather weight and wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide field of vision. I wear this as a commuter and it feels as light at sunup as it does at sundown. The pads and lining are magic. It's one of the most comfortable helmets I've worn. It wicks sweat easy in 90 degree heat.The only drawback is when you're riding urban stop-and-go traffic. The vents are excellent at speed, quiet and cooling, with three crown vents that you can toggle, but there's little flow when you're positioned almost upright because of the tiny mouth vent. The visor and shade will fog up as a consequence, but will also clear quickly.I recommend the AGV K3 SV to safety conscious beginners riding sporties. It's a great value for commuters. There are lots of options for visor colors and styles to keep it interesting.\n",

      "I just recently started riding about 2 months ago, and knew only as much about helmets as I cared to watch on Revzilla (which was a fair amount, honestly) So I tried this thing on and it fit LIKE A GLOVE. Seriously, I went for a trip 2 weeks after purchasing and 4 hours into the trip and no where on my head was it sore. Amazing! The airflow is pretty great as well, considering I have longish thick hair and could feel movement on top of my head. The \"City Cruising\" setting to keep the visor slightly open isn't the easiest to operate with gloves on, but its definitely doable. The top airflow controls on the sides are pretty much impossible to operate while riding, so make sure you have em where you want em, the mouth and center-top are easy to adjust though. Not the quietest helmet, but I have yet to ride on the highway with the vents closed yet. The internal sun visor is a nice option, only the one it came with wasn't that dark at all, I wish it was a couple shades darker to really block the sun, it just takes the edge off really.The only complaint I have isn't about the helmet itself, it's about the cost of replacement visors, they are 50-70 bucks! But this helmet does have the option of getting pinlock visor inserts (even though the visor it comes with isn't pinlock compatible). All in all, love this helmet, just wish the visors weren't so pricey.\n",

I prefer chin mount, which is absolutely impossible. I rigged up a sort of side mount that was then pulled to the front to sit in front of the chin, but it's not ideal and the curvature of the entire front of the helmet is just weird for even a curved mount.-Built-in visor could be darker. Maybe I just have very sensitive eyes (I probably do), but I find myself squinting a bit even with the sun visor down.\n",

      "First off, let me start by saying how surprisingly quiet this helmet is. I ride an FZ-07 so wind is always a big issue, but even with all the vents open, I can comfortably ride at highway speeds with no earplugs. On one occasion I got up in the 100mph range (no comment on whether or not this was on the street...) and even then, the wind noise was manageable, but certainly loud. Others have mentioned that the diagonal vents aren't usable with gloves, but I beg to differ. As long as you pull them at the right angle, you can get them to open/close while riding, though it can be a bit tricky. The only complaint I have with this helmet is the weight. But that doesn't really surprise me, considering how much cheaper it is than, say, a Corsa or a Pista. I've certainly worn heavier. All in all, this is a great mid-range helmet. If you're looking for something better than the really cheap stuff, but you don't want to fork over the cash for a premium helmet, I would wholeheartedly recommend the K3 SV.\n",

      "This is my 1rst AGV helmet and I love it. I have been commuting with it all day and it felt really nice. I have a fairly small head so I got an XS but its still wasn't as tight fit as my Scorpion x710, but manageable. The greatest part was on the freeway, the helmet stayed on, no movement and the hawks-chin really made a difference at high speed compared to a regular helmet. Even at high speeds, the helmet stayed quite. The air vent placement is really good, especially on the chin, the air gets in but its not blowing on my lips getting them chapped as my other helmet does. The only thing I don't like is the visor. Every time I close it, it makes a very loud noise that hurts my ears. During night time there are too many reflections light bouncing of my eyes through it that it makes it harder to ride and stay focused on the road. Overall its a great helmet to be used during day time and high speed riding but its gonna take either a replacement visor or simply getting used to it to be able to ride at night.\n",

      "Premium helmet without the premium price tag--A great mid-level helmet\n",
      "My last helmet was a bargain bin Fulmer (which I actually loved), but I took a lil spill and needed a new one. Since I recently upgraded from a CBR250 to a 600RR, I felt I needed to upgrade to a more premium lid and this helmet fits the bill perfectly. When I measured my head, I was 22 inches, which according to the size chart was a medium-large, but when I tried it on, it felt too loose, so I swapped it for a medium small and it fits me super snug (in fact, I'm actually embarrassed at how loose my old helmet must have been!#. It takes me a little finagling to get my glasses in, but they don't press into my head or bow like they do in some helmets. Plus, I think that's mostly because I have very thin frames with a lot of bend to them.The helmet is very light, feels very solid, and I really like the \"hawks bill\" style. Coming from a sub $100 helmet to this one, I really like the extra features that make it feel more premium, such as the chin curtain #which really helps keep the air in/out), the \"city\"/cracked visor position, the quick change mech for swapping lenses, and the removable liner. Every helmet I saw all these features on was $300+! I also like that it is pre-cut for adding a com system, as that's something I plan to do eventually. The lens is very clear and good with not fogging; however, THE INTERNAL VISOR FOGS UP A LOT AND IF YOU HAVE GLASSES THEY WILL FOG UP EASILY IF THE MAIN SHIELD IS ALL THE WAY DOWN! The saving grace is the city position for the front visor, which allowed me to manage the condensation on the sun visor and my glasses, although this was not really possible at low speeds.\n",

      "After quite a bit of shopping around for the right lid I settled on the AGV K3 SV. I have a smallish head (57 cm) so I ordered the MS and the helmet fit true to size.The Dreamtime graphic is stunning and I'm not even a huge Rossi or MotoGP fan. I was looking for a helmet that had a mix of looks, Hi-Vis, and functionality without getting something with edgy flames on it. While the design is not as Hi-vis as a neon helmet it, it still stands out pretty well. I've received quite a bit of compliments from both friends and strangers on the helmetThe SV has loads of features! I was coming from a scorpion exo 7000 and wow what a difference! the chin strap works just like a snowboard binding, meaning no silly D-rings to fiddle with, just slip it off/on and you're ready to go. the lining is super soft and comfy on my face, while keeping me cool while cruising around town in the heat.The air vents feel like AC in the cool WV fall weather, and the spoiler does not buffet my head around while on the highway. The visor has a nice setting where you can slightly crack it open to prevent it from fogging up for slow speed cruises and extra airflow, although at high speeds I feel like that might shoot up. The drop down sun visor is pretty slick too, I usually wear glasses with the helmet and they are totally unobtrusive to the visor coming down. The sun protection is pretty decent, but I plan to upgrade to a different face shield.The helmet itself is fairly quiet. Paired with decent ear plugs and you might not hear all the honks of approval because of the amazing looks of this helmet. Crossing my fingers that I won't have to test the integrity of the helmet in a crash anytime soon, but the helmet feels sturdy and lightweight enough that it instills confidence.All in all for this price it's an excellent deal. I bought it for $230 and even then it's a great value if you're looking for your first helmet or just something different.\n",

      "Great improvement over the regular K3\n",
      "Im extremely impressed with this helmet! I have the AGV K3 5 Continents (Rossi graphics) helmet and found it had a few drawbacks so I took a chance a tried out this K3 SV version. It basically fixes all the gripes I have with the regular K3.1. Has plenty of room for your ears plus cut outs for Bluetooth communication speakers. The old K3 squished my ears pretty tightly and good luck finding any room to mount speakers comfortably.I run a Sena SMH-10 Bluetooth headset and it fits perfectly. Nice room for the boom mic and the speakers fit perfectly in the K3 SV cutouts. Seriously took me less than 5 minutes to install and test.2. The flip down sun visor is a cool and functional addition although there is some slight distortion.3. The windshield feels more solidly built and smoother to raise and lower.4. Never really had an issue with the vents and cooling of the regular K3 but this SV version seems to be more effective. Haven't put a ton of miles on this helmet yet so it could just be Im riding on cooler days. Also slightly quieter.5. Padding feels more comfortable for every day use. The regular K3 almost feels like a race helmet in comparison.Overall, this is a fantastic bang-for-the-buck helmet with a bunch of nice features. It really is a whole new helmet compared to the regular K3. Almost confused as to why they even use K3 in the name.\n",

      "This is my second helmet after being bike only for 3 years now. My first helmet was $50 more then this one. In comparison they fit rather differently. This one is easy to take on and off, my first felt squished taking on and off. Even though this one goes on and off easier it feels snugger on my face in cheeks but in a comfortable way. There is cut out where your ears go and that provides a lot of comfort as i often ride with headphones. There is also wind that goes between my ears which is a plus since i live in Florida and it is always hot. The front has a tab that vents the sheild slightly which provides more airflow but also works great as a defogger. Chemical coats wear off eventually so its nice there is a second system to defogg. I wish it had Pin Lock but this is a nice touch. It bobbles very little at high speeds but with all the airflow it is louder but i expect that and do not mind. The internal sun visors are decent. I have seen complaints about them not being dark enough but if you get the iridium ones it works fine. Wont block all the sun but what will. They have nice coverage and easy to access. The look is sharp and has nice cuts to helpit with comfort as well around the neck. The inner linning stays dry and is very soft. Over all i am thrilled with this helmet. I ride everyday rain or shine, light or dark. It is very versitile for my bike only needs.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet partly because it looks great and second, the airflow configurations. The airflow is great, here in FL it gets very hot mid-day and this helmet keeps my head dry, and cool which is a godsend with 90F++ temps with high humidity. The anti-fog visor works great, i have not had any problems with the visor fogging up(Drove through a few heavy T-storms, and afternoon showers). A con is while it is wet outside the mouth vent does shoot rain into your face.Also while the visor does not fog up, the seal around the visor does lets a bit of water in.This helmet is very loud, no way around it. Wear your ear plug, I have had issues with the helmet whistling, but it does go away eventually, not really that annoying in my opinion.Sizing, I usually wear a medium, but the Med-L fits me perfectly, it is nice and comfy.\n",

      "Purchased this as a replacement for my rashed K3 and have been very happy with it. It feels more like a distinct helmet than a version of the K3. Fit and finish is top notch and it feels like a much more expensive piece. The faceshield mechanism is improved over the K3 and the sun visor is smooth, easy to use and feels quality. It may be a bit heavier than the K3 but thats understandable given the features. I feel that comfort, quality and noise are superb especially given the pricepoint.Note that it uses the GT2 face shield http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/agv-gt-2-face-shield\n",

      "This is my second helmet that I've ever owned, and this is a huge upgrade over my Speed and Strength SS700. The air flow is excellent, the vents move a nice stream of fresh air to your nose and mouth. When you stand still for awhile it can get hot, but you immediately feel a relief at 20mph because of the excellent flow. It's significantly more quiet than my last helmet as well. The little flip down sun visor is cool but I can't ever see myself actually using it, especially since I got the iridium silver visor (highly recommended by the way). My biggest problem is the D ring straps, I'm not a fan of them because they take so long to get on and off. Just a heads up, these helmets run a little small. Based on the measurements I should wear a large, but an XL is very snug on my head. I'd imagine they run around an inch size differenxe small. Excellent helmet for an excellent price!\n",

      "Good bang for the buck. it's comfortable and light.It's loud as a hurricane, but I never go over 55 in it, it's the scooter helmet. Otherwise I think I'd go deaf.There's a great mirrored sun shield available for this, so I bought it, and I never use the drop down sun visor, which is useless to me anyway. Like all drop down sun visors, it doesn't cover enough of the vision, and this helmet has a cheap drop down visor that distorts vision because the plastic is cheap. So basically it's useless to me, but the available mirror shield makes it for it completely.I have a Sena 20S on it. I had to dremel out the speaker holes to install the Sena. It was easy to do with the dremel and I don't think it compromised the safety of the helmet. If your comfortable with tools then installing the bluetooth system isn't a problem.Great graphics available.\n",

      "I've had this helmet for a few weeks now, so I've had a chance to break it in and get to know its high points and weak spots. Overall, a great helmet. For the money I do recommend it. Similar size and weight to my old Arai (I measured), added bonus of the sun visor........The sizing is great, especially if you're in between a Medium and Small like me. The fit is wonderful, best part of the whole helmet! Makes for a painless and easy break in period.....The helmet delivers most of what my expensive Arai did at a fraction of the cost! The final polish is missing-- that's where the money went......Now the knocks: My biggest gripe is that the chin vent is useless. Blows wind and dust right up into my eyes. I end up riding with the visor popped up on the tab just below it all the time instead. This works okay, but cuts down on the airflow quite a bit. I worry that when it gets really hot I'm gonna hate it. Granted, I haven't used the helmet with the chin curtain removed yet, so maybe that will help...... Chin strap is extra long, but there is a small elastic band on the strap liner to tuck the excess up..... Visor does not have the feeling of quality or rigidity of the older Arai I'm coming from..... As I mentioned helmet size isn;t an issue for me in the MS, but only two shell sizes makes me wonder whether if you have a XS or Med+ head size if you're going to look like a bobblehead.....\n",

I got a ML because my AFX (L) was starting to get wobbly after two years.The fit is perfect. Snug in all the right places. The anti-fog visor is true to its name. Even at a standstill you have to try hard to get it to fog up. The drop-down tinted visor isn't anti fog tho, nor does it claim to be. It also isn't that dark.I installed an ECHO quick release snap because I was spoiled after years of AFX's ratchet retention system.The pointed chinbar really does cut through the air.

The build in sun-visor is pretty useless - it distorts the vision a lot and I never want to bother getting accustomed to it.The airflow is amazing on this helmet - I'm always comfortable in it. However due to the great airflow there is also a great deal of wind noise at highway speed. In the street there is hardly much noise due to the lower speeds.The helmet itself is very stylish especially given the low price tag. I would definitely buy again.

      "This is my second agv (first was the xr2). I have a normal shaped head and this helmet fits good. There is still plenty room towards the nose. I got the solid black, and the finish is great. There is quite a bit of room in the ear pieces, much more than my xr2. The lining is good, but I have to admit that my xr2 was much softer. This helmet breathes extremely well, more than the xr2 by a long shot. I wouldn't say it is a quiet helmet, I think my xr2 was quieter. I use ear plugs anyway, I suspect the vents make it loud, like any high venting helmet would. This helmet is also very stable at speeds (I ride a naked bike). The drop down visor works as expected, although it's not very dark. I can also see a little distortion in it. But for more than half of the shoei gt air, I am very pleased with this helmet. It is not heavy whatsoever. I was disappointed that it didn't have the ratchet chin strap as the Europeans get, but I've always had the double d ring, so that's okay. I did see it in the description, I was just hoping it was a misprint :-)\n",

I cannot give enough thanks to AGV for coming out with this helmet, I'm a female rider so it was important to me to find a helmet that was lightweight, and not obviously feminine (aka the silly butterflies and flowers on ALLLLL of the women's helmets in any brand)... The hawksbill makes the side view of the helmet gorgeous. The acoustics within the helmet (the wind noise/ ability to hear out of a Bluetooth) are phenomenal. I tested the helmet at high speeds, and my head doesn't blow all over the place like my previous helmet. The drop-down visor could be a bit darker, but that's it.\n",

      "I was very excited to get the helmet based on the review.  My only complaint is the wind noise but its a big complaint.  Just took it out of the box and went on a  400 plus mile trip to see my boy at college.  I stopped to purchase multiple forms of ear plugs.  Even with ear plugs it is very loud.  The wind blocks out the sound of the bike and cars but the wind noise is beyond distracting.  Shrugging my shoulders makes it go away so there is a serious design issue allowing air in under the helmet. Bigger pad options at the botton edge of the helmet may solve it but they are not available.   It is unfortunate you cannot return a helmet after it is worn but it is impossible to know this without a ride.  Wax ear plugs work best.  This is very upsetting after spending $500.  If racing at the track in a very tucked position maybe its not an issue but for the rest of us there is no fix I can find.  It is hard to see why this is a best selling helmet.  I cannot see what I am missing here.\n",

Still I have invested in some moto specific ear plugs as at high speeds wind noise is still there and I value my hearing. Things I'd change about the helmet... the notch to open the shield is on the left ..

I had a $100 dollar helmet thrown in as part of my deal.  It met my needs of protecting my head.  But any ride at speed or longer than just a few minutes my neck was killing me.  So I decided to try a Shoei since I had had one 35 years ago.  It was difficult to make the decision because I am on a tight budget.  I love it and am very happy with Revzilla's service and shipping / packaging.  specific to the helmet it is the same size as my $100 dollar helmet but side to side it looks much smaller, much more aerodynamic and best of all my neck does not hurt even on a long ride on the interstate.  Airflow is better than the cheap helmet but still hot on a hot day.  Overall my motorcycle is a fun vehicle not my only transportation and I want to enjoy when I ride not be miserable so worth the money yes!  Other ways to rate I am not experienced enough.

      "I commute 33miles daily to and from work. I need something that works all the time and is still good for long distance trips.Living in the south near Nashville gets hot in the summer and we sometimes get freezing rain in the winter. So, I need a “Do-it-all” kind of helmet. I used to have an EXO-1100, but they don’t make them any more, and the replacement it’s better. I also didn’t want a helmet with those flip down visors, since wind noise becomes amplified..they’re a nice feature, just doesn’t help with noise. You don’t realize how quiet the helmet can get until you get rid of that visor.  As for noise on the Shoei, you do hear it when you open all of the vents, but it worth the cooling. Sort of like when you open your windows on a car at highway speed, sure it’s a little loud, but you get used to it, and you can’t beat the cooling. I like the adjustable visor height, as in the cool months I make it smaller than in the summer months. Though, when you open the mouth vent and have a pin-sheild installed, I haven’t seen any fogging up. There is one issue with this helmet...the Sena S10 I installed. It usually only takes like 20 minutes to get it in, but it took over an hour and a half, due to how sealed this helmet is built. The build really helps to keep the noise down, but very hard to run wires.I’ll keep this for another 4yrs, then replace it with the same one, as this has become my “Go-To” brand. The other pricey brands are nice, but not worth the extra cost. This is a very premium helmet, at a cost that is worth it. Sure, it’s more than a Bell or Scorpion, but it’s better function and form in all aspects.\n",

      "This is my first helmet. After searching and searching I knew I wanted to have something that would last and have a great safety rating. The venting is excellent, something I was worried about being I've never used a helmet before and the weather here in Kansas was in the low 100s when I was making my purchase. All in all I'd recommend this helmet for anyone looking for a premium starting helmet. I ride a custom sportster 1200 and the flat black paired great with the bike\n",

      "Not to say Im disappointed in the helmet, but for the price I expected to have no complaints. Air flow could use some improvement, and wind noise is significant for a full face. I have a skinny neck, so that might affect the air entering through the bottom. Works well with glasses. The pin lock anti fog shield is amazing. Emergency release cheek pads are great for peace of mind. Easy to remove and reinsert comfort liners for drying. I have not purchased a Sena 30X yet but I plan to soon, I will update my review when I install it.\n",

      "I purchased this from Revzilla about two weeks ago and have over 500 miles wearing it. The fit and finish is up there with Arai and the airflow is amazing. I shave my head and I can feel the air going over the top of my head. Even when it was 102 degrees F out, the helmet was cool (well as cool as it can get at that temp). The vent switches are well built and the interior is comfortable to the face. It is damn light and if it wasn't for my cheeks being pressed together like a fish face, you wouldn't even know it was on (slight exaggeration).Now for the cons. It is pretty loud, and the rear vent is not marked and I cannot tell if it is open, or closed. Even shining a flashlight in there, I cannot tell. The air vent switches are not easy to use with gloves on (very common in pretty much every helmet). The face shield is pretty hard to move up and down especially when it is latched -- you almost feel like you may break it when trying to crack it open.I opted for the transition shield and other than getting over the 200+ price that I paid (ouch), it is awesome. This is the first helmet that I owned with pin lock and I have yet to have fogging which is important to me since I ride all year in Colorado. You cannot go wrong with this helmet as can be easily seen in all the positive reviews.\n",

      "I like this Hemet alot. I first had a Scorpion R420 and that didn't fit, had terrible airflow and was uncomfortable.The RF1200 is so much better, I can actually feel the air going through the helmet with the 4 vents, it fits my head perfectly and is super comfortable. The only things I don't like are the field of view and how loud it is. I have to take my hand if the handlebars so that I can do a headcheck on the freeway, really I just wish the face shield was longer so that I could see more of if the sides. It's also a little loud at speeds higher than 70MPH. I wear custom molded earplugs that cut the sound by about 47 Decibels and it's still too loud at higher speeds. I've heard the GT Air and GT Air II are quiter and have more airflow(even then the RF1200 airflow is amazing) so looking back I probably would purchase that instead.I won't be returning my RF1200 since it's an amazing helmet overall but I do wish I could see more and that it was quiter.\n"

I can definitely second this airflow as it's phenomenal. I've worn this helmet into the mid-90s and as long as I'm in motion with all vents open, I don't get too hot even with the visor closed. The helmet also has cutouts inside to add speakers, but I found them too small to fit the JBL speakers of my Cardo system. Fortunately the material covering the earholes still allows my to fit comfortably fit the speakers. I was also happy to see that they included a pinlock anti-fog visor. I would wholeheartedly recommend this helmet too anyone looking for a solid high quality helmet. It is worth every penny.\n",

      "This helmet is extremely comfortable. I recently took a Harley Davidson course to improve my safety and overall riding which required me to wear a helmet for 3 hours at a time before breaks on top of that I lead in 90 degree weather, I have to admit I was so glad I had my shoei. My head was breathing of fresh air and I had no head aches or pressured points from wearing the helmet for that long which tells you it is in fact a great helmet for the money. The other guys in the course were extremely sweaty and seamed uncomfortable most likely due to their whack helmets. They should of got a shoei. Over all this is what protects your head from turning to a squished grape after a crash... it’s worth every penny.\n",

I primarily ride a Yamaha FJR with the windshield up around my mouth/nose level and this helmet is quiet: barely any wind noise. However, lower the windshield much and this thing become very loud.

Still...I live in the north east US and spring and summer are warm. The helmet fits great, not much noise, and very impressed that I have zero itch on the crown of my head.

The pinlock system is amazing, so far I've had zero issues with any fog whatsoever. Ventilation is great and plenty of airflow.

I was glad the option was available.So far the helmet has been great. Easy to put on and Easy to take off. Easy control of the many vents with gloves bands. Pin lock works flawlessly.

Also the chin does not come down as far and my wife said it almost looks to small for my head compared to the RF-1000.

      "I just bought my RF 1200 to replace a 3/4 helmet I had been wearing.  My first impressions are great.  I have an intermediate oval head shape, and this helmet is very comfortable, and pretty light.  I bought it in XL, based on the sizing guide, and it fits as it should.  I wore the helmet when I first unboxed it for about 45 minutes while I was watching TV, and I did not notice any hot spots, and I almost forgot that I was wearing a helmet.I have a Cardo PackTalk Slim that I took out of my 3/4 helmet, and installed it into my RF 1200, using the short clamp and short skirt.  I checked the compatible helmets on Cardo's website, and the RF 1200 is not listed, but it still fits just fine.  I did have to bend the short clamp slightly, so that the battery pack sits flush and level with the back of the helmet, but that was easy enough.This helmet flows a lot more air than my 3/4 helmet, and is way quieter, but I would expect a full face helmet to be quieter than a 3/4.  I will say that with the PackTalk Slim mounted, I do hear a little bit of noise from the wind hitting it, but it is really not bad at all.I also noticed that there is considerably less buffeting with the RF 1200 than my previous helmet, which is really nice at higher speeds.I rode to work this morning, and it was only about 45 degrees outside, and I did notice some fogging of the face mask, but I did not have the pinlock inner shield installed, so I will try that out tomorrow morning, as it is supposed to eliminate fogging.All in all, this is a great helmet, and I would recommend it!\n",

      "I didn't know what a great helmet was until I finally sprung for this Shoei. Had a HJC before (not their top of the line stuff)...and  this helmet made that helmet feel like it was worth $20. A helmet is everything and you want it to be comfortable which this was. It's almost as if I'm not wearing one ??. Definitely worth the price for your life.\n",

      "Perfect aerodynamics but noisy and hot.\n",
      "Style:As a long time wearer of HJCs this was my first \"nice\" helmet purchase. Right off the bat the quality of the materials, workmanship, and finish are apparent. Even the chin strap looks and feels premium (at least compared to HJC). The graphics and overall quality of the paint and finish are absolutely flawless and clearly applied with a great deal of care. The slightly smaller shell size (though still too large) takes away from the worst aspects of the bulb head I got from HJC. Finally the overall shape and aesthetics are very eye catching with a feel of modern design principles seen throughout in the minimal yet highly refined protrusions of the helmet. The vents are seamlessly integrated into the overall shape of the helmet. The only con I'd give is that despite Shoei's marketing stating that this helmet comes in a wide range of shell sizes, I still feel as if this is too large. A medium RF-1200 with standard thickness pads feel perfect for me. If you are able to (some dealers might!) consider trying on a smaller size with thinner pads. The shell size is by no means gives you a large bubble headed appearance like cheaper helmets do but I do feel as if it is still slightly too large. Fit & Comfort:As for the fit, go try it on! Ignore advice about helmet shapes and put one on and wear it for as long as possible. Walk around for 10 minutes looking at some bikes in the dealership pretend like you're there to buy a bike whatever! Make sure it's tight enough on your cheeks that if you open your mouth your teeth slightly (barely a graze) bite into your cheeks when you close it and that if you were to grab the helmet and rotate it around your head, it moves your scalp with it instead of moving over it. The helmet is comfortable as far as pressure and softness of materials go. There is no itch for me whatsoever. I don't think that the helmet flows air very well at all. I don't get the instant and noticeable feel of cool air on my sweaty head like I did with the cheapest HJC full faces available. Having the vents open does make my head feel almost imperceptibly cooler however. I see other people complain about the flow of air up behind the chin-bar and through the visor. I did not experience this at all. There are instructions included for aligning the visor and making certain that the visor seals against the gasket correctly. The level of noise in this helmet is atrocious, especially for the lack of adequate venting. Road and wind noise gets fatiguing fast and I absolutely never without earplugs. I wish more thought had gone into the ear-cups to both quiet it down and make the installation of helmet speakers more seamless. The last and in my opinion, the best feature of this helmet I would like to review is the aerodynamic design. With all of my HJCs, it was a struggle just keep my head and neck comfortable from all the buffeting I experienced. Just a constant shaking of my head. With the RF-1200 that has disappeared entirely. This helmet absolutely slices through the air like it's not even there. Even if turn my head there is next to no buffeting. I ride an upright position bike with no windscreen whatsoever. There was a great deal of work put into the aerodynamic design of this helmet and it shows.Oh the chin curtain is dope btw\n",

      "This helmet is hands down the best I’ve owned. It’s light and comfortable to wear for hours on end. The airflow is great compared to the other helmets I’ve owned. I’ll definitely be buying another Shoei when the time comes! On a side note the speaker pockets are a tad small to fit the Sena 20s speakers. I picked up a pair of Sena slim speakers off amazon for cheap and they fit perfectly in the pockets and functioned flawlessly with the 20s.\n",

      "From a Bell Bullitt to the RF-1200... worth it!\n",
      "I ride a Truxton R and have worn a Bell Bullitt. I have slightly larger ears and felt a lot of discomfort on the Bullitt, so I decided to go with a premium lid. This helmet is absolutely amazing! Its really quiet, extremely comfortable, looks slick, and the pinlock works very well! Venting... The helmet flows a lot of air. Some people here have mentioned that air seems to blow directly towards the eyes. Yes, that is true but it is an easy fix. There is a screw around shield latch. You can adjust that screw so that the shield will close closer to the lid and thereby prevent air from coming through. I did it after my first ride, and its been perfect since. Comfort... You get what you pay for. This helmet is expensive but extremely comfortable. I cannot express the difference between the bullet and the 1200. I'm just glad I don't feel like I'm about to rip my big ears off every time I remove a helmet. Just try the premium lid and see for yourself. Vision... My only slight -very slight- grip is the vision. Coming from the Bullitt, which has a larger shield and opening, it took a bit to get used to. My vision is never obstructed and limited by any measurable means; its just something I had to get used to. I can easily see my gauges, my mirror, and adjacent lanes. Noise... Here it is: this helmet is really quiet. There is almost zero wind buffeting or whistling noise. At speeds 70+ you are not deafened by the wind. When I got the helmet, the first thing I did was add the chin curtain. I have not ridden without the curtain so I cannot say if theres more noise without it.Final thought... I would absolutely recommend this helmet. Special thanks to Revzilla for helping me find the correct fit, color, at a great price.\n",

      "Upgraded from a Scorpion EXO-1100. Aerodynamics are noticably superior on a naked bike. I can look over my shoulder at any road legal speed without no feeling like my head will get ripped off. It's also quieter, lighter, and less bulky. Airflow is excellent and anti-fog vents worked perfectly with no pinlock installed @ 45 degrees.With that said I miss integrated sun shields and the Scorpion air cheek pads. At 170# I seem to be in the minority in that I will probably get tighter cheek pads after a few hundred more miles. For the price point an option of visor tint and a couple of sets of pads would be nice. Adding those two things quickly makes this a $600 helmet.\n",

It’s a helmet that just does everything really well, looks good, and I’m sure would provide a high level of protection in a crash (luckily I haven’t had to test this). It’s nice and compact and is easy to use with a bluetooth headset. I’m starting to look at another helmet as this one has had a ton of use and I can’t think of another helmet I would rather have.

      "I am 32 yrs old and have been riding motorcycles all my life. This helmet is the most comfortable helmet ive owned hands down. currently riding a 2017 R6. When I first put it on, it was extra snug but this was expected. After about 2 weeks of regular riding, the helmet formed to my head perfectly. The range of motion I have with this helmet is most noticeable.. from over the shoulder checking to the full tuck position. and even looking around while at a stop light. I also noticed riding in rain was actually pleasant. No rain got inside and the rain is immediately shed away when riding. THE ONLY thing i can really say negative about the helmet would be the sound(55+mph) It isnt a deal breaker. It isnt unbearable. but i can say i was expecting it to be quieter. even with all vents closed. (note, i havent installed the chin curtain, but cant imagine it changes too much) also speaking of vents. All vents are nice and easy to manage with gloves on. The rear vents are the only ones some what difficult to understand open vs closed. Overall this is a 5 star helmet and would recommend this model to anyone in the market for a quality daily helmet that is still track approved and ready.Thank you SHOEI and Revzilla!\n",

      "This helmet replaced a Shoei RF-1100 that was about 5 years old and had over 20,000 miles on it. I've put about 250 miles on the 1200 so far and it seems to be just as nice as the 1100. The shield seals very well and even includes a pinlock insert, which cost about $50 if you were to buy separately. All of the vents are easy to operate with gloves on and do not feel cheap/flimsy. The liner has a nice feel and does a good job of wicking moisture. The finish is perfect and feels like it will hold up for a long time. This helmet isn't as light as some helmets in the same price range and doesn't have  drop down sunscreen but it definitely has better feel and quality than anything in this price range.\n"

      "I have been riding bikes for years and decided to buy a premium helmet. I have been buying HJC-CL17 helmets for years and figured on getting a new one for an upcoming trip I was taking on my Goldwing. Well, the very first thing I noticed was how much louder the helmet was than my HJC. Im a musician and very keen with my hearing. It was incredibly louder even behind the large windshield on my bike. Next, I had constant creaking from the material inside the helmet on top of my head. Maybe it needed to be broken in but I have never had that problem in any other helmet. It added to the noise and it sucked. Third, wind movement was worse in this helmet than my HJC - by far. Fourth, installing my Sena 10R went through until I had to make a slight cutout in the cheekpad. The wire pushed on the pad and it stuck the pad out a bit. This is more of an annoyance, but why in the hell wouldnt they make a modern helmet setup for a bluetooth unit!? My HJC was better in every way and Im very sorry I spent the money on this helmet. It will definitely be my last from Shoei.\n",

I ride in NYC in summer heat, and am always flipping my visor up. This one is sticky and awkward. It's  takes effort to flip up. Tedious.There is a beveled edge on the bottom of the visor. If you have it partially open, it obscures vision. Not nice. And also at night, it catches light weirdly and refracts it.

I commute on the bike during all seasons and it has been a solid helmet through rain, heat and light snow. (Pinlock does wonders esp the transitional pinlock rocks!)

      "I was right in between a medium and large... I took the Revzilla geek advice and went with the smaller medium size. I ordered the thinner 31mm cheek inserts (stock comes with 35mm) just in case. I am glad I did, these made a medium helmet fit my head perfectly. Just for reference my head diameter measures right around 22-7/8\" to 23\" which is literally in between the sizing charts. As far as the helmet goes, I took back to back to back rides switching between the RF-1200 and my HJC IS-MAX 2 Harley helmet. I came to the conclusion the Shoei really isn't much quieter (maybe slightly) but the clarity through the visor, peripheral  vision (and vertical vision), overall comfort/fit is far superior. I ride a 2018 Harley Fatbob so upright but aggressive upright for a Harley and I can now see my speedometer without looking down. Head checks for lane changes is much better as I don't have to turn my head as far and the wind drag is also less when turning my head. the price tag was a little bit of sticker shock but I felt my safety is worth it. I also ordered the thinner top pad (I don't think I'll need) and the transitions visor is on its way now from Revzilla as I can't wait to try to so I don't have to use drop down visor or carry additional shields. Overall I am very pleased & satisfied... I contemplated longer than I am proud to admit between the RF-SR and the RF-1200 (and Arai Defiant-X but too costly)... I went with the advice of Revzilla and the Cycle Gear guys in Indianapolis. The additional $80 was likely worth it if we're in this price point category. The only thing I think didn't meet my expectations is I thought the sound would be quieter (it was really only a factor 60+ MPH). I only have about 150 miles in it so far but so far so good. I intend on adding Bluetooth on it next. I would highly recommend this helmet!\n",

Pros: The style and color options available through Shoei are what would make me consider buying another.  The airflow is very good with the vents open.  Pinlock keeps the visor from fogging.  It is very lightweight.  Lane checks on the highway don’t result in a lot of wind resistance.  Cons: wind noise at highway speeds is about the same as my Nolan.  There is a whistle with the visor up at 35-45, but it should be closed at that speed anyway.  It scratches very easily.It is a nice helmet and I’d buy another.\n",

This helmet shape fits very snugly without feeling too squishy. I also like that's meets both DOT and Snell standards.\n",

      "I must be mad, because I bought a silver RF-1200 three weeks after buying a matte blue Neotec 2. #ShoeiUpAndTakeMyMoneyI have only one beef with the RF-1200: it's a bear to put on and take off. My melon is right on the small/medium divide, so I got the small (to allow for break-in and wear - my previous medium lids tend to develop bobblehead after a while) and replaced the stock 35mm cheek pads with 31. The shell is very stiff and doesn't really flex enough (or at all) when I pull the chin straps out, so my ears take some abuse in both directions. Once it's on and settled, though, it's sublime.The RF actually feels cooler inside than the Neo, even though the Neo has far better ventilation. I've heard that helmet color doesn't affect interior temps, but my own experience is that silver and white lids run cooler. Take that for what it's worth.The RF is eerily quiet, especially with my foam earplugs. This afternoon's ride included 80+ miles at 75 mph beating into a 25 mph headwind; I had far less wind noise at an effective 100 mph than any other helmet I've ever owned, and far less buffeting.Build quality is phenomenal. The interior padding is typical Shoei plush and very easy to remove and install. The visor is absolutely stout and solid. The controls snap with authority. The breath guard and chin curtain take five seconds to swap out. I didn't bother installing the pinlock insert on this one, but I did on the Neo and it was completely painless.I should have gotten the RF-1200 when it first came out. This is gonna be my go-to for the next several years.\n",

      "I am an intermediate oval to long oval and Shoei has always been a great fit. I own both the GT-Air and the RF-1200 and, depending on your neck size, these could be quieter than others. Between the two, I wear my RF-1200 for 90% of my riding. The GT-Air is great in some cases but I found the RF-1200 the most comfortable helmet I've owned and happy with my choice. I've done thousands of miles in this helmet over the past few months and would buy it again and again. I highly recommend getting a transitional lens/visor as well -- yes. It's expensive but just do it. Again, The GT-Air seems louder although it's less turbulent  because of it's shape (also tight even with cheek and internal pad changes) but the RF-1200 has a better fit and with a transitional lens, It's my go-to for years to come. Also, I'm 180lbs, 5'10\" average/athletic build with 16\" neck and installed Windjammers on these making the helmets MUCH quieter.\n",

I bought the Large size and had to buy an XL pad to have a perfect fit. The L pad is squishing my cheeks too much. But once I replace it with the XL pad, this helmet fits awesome on my head. I took it on cross country trip from Riverside, CA to Orlando, FL and back in January 2018. The helmet did great under all weather conditions. Rain is not an issue. Hail no problem. Heat no issue because of great air flow. Noise is tolerable. Fog is an issue but that is solved with the Pin Shield Insert that was included with the helmet.

With the exception of the cheek pads being too tight, replaced them with the 31mm pads and they are still a bit snug but not uncomfortable, just not as roomy as i would like for longer rides...but in the event of a crash, i know that tighter is better. I assume this tight fit is part of the Snell criteria. The Snell rating brings peace of mind, although its a bit pricey, a helmet is not something to go cheap on. No buyers remorse on this investment. Noise is really not an issue, no problems hearing my headphones, even at highway speeds i can blast my music or talk on the phone with no problem. Sena 20s mounted up nicely and the recessed speaker pockets were just the right size. Overall, this helmet is 5 stars but im only giving it 4 because i had to spend extra money on thinner cheakpads. Would be nice if we could select cheekpads the same way we can select color. Would buy this again. Ride Safe.\n",

It's quiet even though airflow is above average for this type of helmet. And lastly, it looks really, really good. The only con I have is the insane price of $170 Shoei charges for their transissions shield. If Bell can sell a Snell rated helmet that includes a transissions shield for a total of $250, I'm thinking a Shoei that starts at $500 can charge a hell of a lot less for theirs.\n",

With mininal riding time since receipt, I'm still waiting for the 10% lining shrinkage, so it's still, as it should be, a bit snug. On the questionable side, this is my first time sround with the 'PinLock' feature. I was surprised to see in the Shoei instructions the requirement to remove after use to avoid deterioration of the silicone seal, meaning a removal and reinstallation every day. Also, surprised to see it reduces light transmission by 20% (80% transmission), meaning it can't be worn at night. Otherwise, a standout on my unfaired/non-windscreen T-120 with regard to quiet performance. Highly recommended!\n",

      "I didn't purchase this helmet through Revzilla but I wanted to leave a review about it because of my experience with it. First would be the style of it, I had a white one and bought the beautiful dark smoke from revzilla. I got so many compliments on the look of my helmet, and I hadn't even modified it at all. The air flow is perfect, the chin one keeps you from fogging up when you're moving and the ones on top keep you from getting a sweaty head. Plus there's not much wind noise through them when they are all open.I've never felt like there was anything around me that I couldn't see in the field of view this helmet gives. I did find that whenever I had to drive my car this summer all I could think about was how much I missed not having pillars to block my view!This was my first helmet so I did research and found what I thought to be a helmet that would someday save my life if I needed it to. Unfortunately I failed to keep in mind the head shape. So while I loved this helmet it did not fit my head, my own fault though.And to come to the reason I won't be wearing this helmet next year, and why I wanted to review it. Yesterday morning while unlocking my bike and taking it off the stand the bike tipped over and fell onto my helmet. I know that not all the weight of the bike would transfer to the helmet but I'm pretty impressed that it didn't do any major damage. After struggling for a bit to get my bike up I found that the fork gouged into the helmet and something else took out the front vent but it was otherwise fine.I guess I'll be on the look out for a new helmet for next season.

I went down going about 70 mphs, flipping down the freeway. I landed on my head a few times and hit pretty hard on the side by the temple and slid across the shield a couple times. The helmet didn't fall off or crack and same goes for the shield. I walked away with no head injuries. This helmet is definitely worth the investment and is going to be my next helmet for sure.

      "Bear in mind as you read this, I'm upgrading from a HJC CL17, size large, (a size to big, but it felt great in the showroom).  The shoei RF1200 solid, in \"Anthracite\" is an awesome display of quality workmanship.  everything from the vent closures, to the visor has a solid, smooth feel... not flimsy or cheap.  The fit on my 58cm/22.75\" head is snug but comfy (with the cheek pads out) and slightly tight with the cheekpads in on this medium helmet.  (I ordered based on the size chart this time, and I understand from others that this is the proper fit, and when the pads break in it'll be more comfortable.)  The helmet is noticeably lighter and smaller externally than my HJC (thankfully).  The snug neck roll and included chin curtain make the helmet much quieter than the rather \"windy\" interior of the HJC.  My only gripe with this helmet is that the buckle end of the chin strap could be a half inch longer... the snap is juuuuust under the neck roll, and isn't as easy to snap as the HJC... but with practice i don't expect it to be an issue.  (Another online MC site had the same gripe on an older review, so this issue may be a recurring one.)  Also, the piece of cloth that cushions the neck strap isn't attached to it, so it never lines up to cushion my neck... again, a minor issue I can fix myself with a needle and thread... But not an issue on my old sub-$200 HJC.  Overall, happy with my purchase.\n",

      "I wear a 7 3/8 - 7 1/2 hat size and the XL fits me snugly but comfortably.  On/off isn't bad at all. Airflow is quite good for the level of protection. I ride in a tropical climate, and my head stays reasonably cool. The visor has a positive seal. Biggest part I've noticed about the helmet: very quiet. They've done a great job here. Style note: I love my matte black. Matches multiple riding outfits and I don't look like a squid...Recommend this helmet.\n",

      "Great helmet, inspires confidence while riding\n",
      "This helmet makes you feel much more secure while riding. SHOEI's protection in this helmet is great. Snell approved.Personally I think the paddings are kind of annoying to take out/put in if you're washing them. I've seen new helmets move to magnets inside, rather than the clicking plastic locks. That could be a cool change for the next revision of this helmet.I went with Matte Black. I like the look a lot, it's been sort of difficult to keep in good condition. I do my best to always keep it in the SHOEI supplied soft bag that comes with the helmet.The chin straps are very short on the left strap (the strap with the female button for closure), however more of an annoyance than a real issue.Air flow is pretty good here. The vents, with all 5 closed noticeably reduce air noise if you have them shut while on the highway. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the design of how some of the vents work, but they feel high quality nonetheless.This helmet is slightly heavier than I was expecting, but for a high protection helmet, that is a price you pay. Personally I have found shoulder checks with this helmet to be tricky - sometimes when I go to shoulder check, the wind will catch my helmet and kind of push my head back, just be careful there.**NOTE**: This helmet does not play well with Sena's 20S bluetooth comm. It is entirely Sena's fault for increasing the diameter of their speakers. Beware of this, and highly consider going with the older Sena comm (SMH 10) over the 20s if you're going to get this helmet.\n",

      "Before the Shoei RF-1200 I tried a Bell Qualifier DLX MiPS Accelerator helmet.Based on the charts I am a large but the Bell Qualifier DLX was unbearably tight however a large Shoei RF-1200 is true to size and fits like a glove. It's probably one of the most comfortable helmets that I have ever worn. I am glad I didn't try sizing up to an XL. If the cheeks are tight you can always simply swap out the cheek pads for thinner ones but in my case it wasn't necessary. Ordered the Black Metallic with dark smoke smoke face shield and it looks amazing!Great quality helmet.\n",

      "I bought this helmet and 5 days later took a spill. I hit my head, sent in the helmet for an inspection performed by Shoei, and they determined that the ECS liner collapsed, essentially saving me from any head injury. I was unharmed, even after smacking my head on the pavement. Once my claim settles I will surely be getting another RF-1200.The helmet is unbelievably comfortable, quiet, and snug. At high speeds, even on a naked bike, the aerodynamics are not compromised. The helmet remains quiet, the shape allows for a good tuck position, and the air flow is awesome. It's also decently easy to install a SENA system, but if you don't already have one, do your research as SENA makes a Shoei-specific product. I've tried a lot of helmets. I have had $100 helmets and I have tried $1200 helmets. The Shoei RF-1200 definitely has the best overall package I have experienced.\n",

      "I'm still recovering from a head-on collision with a car that pulled out in front of me.  Figured this was the best time to give my reviews on the gear I was wearing that saved my life.This lid took the brunt force of my landing.  I was going about 30mph when the crash happened, but I got launched into the air, did 2 full somersaults, and landed on my head and right shoulder.  I woke up in the ambulance, no broken bones and aware enough to contact my work and family as to which hospital I was going to.  CT scans showed a minor brain hemorrhage.  It didn't keep bleeding, in fact, it was most likely due to the momentum from spinning mid-air and landing on my head.  Pretty lucky.  Only scrapes on the helmet, no broken pieces or cracks.  Full stars for taking the impact like a boss and saving my life.As a commuter, this was my go-to helmet.  It's comfortable, though a little bulky, but it was relatively quiet and I never had any issues with wind when I would look over my shoulder on the freeway.  I love the pinlock visor SO FREAKIN MUCH!  Never get fog, never interferes with my vision...it's the best.  Didn't get in the way when I crashed either (was concerned that the pinlock screen would pop out and hit my face...never happened).  Visor is easy to move and easy to change (honestly, the dark smoke tint was still very manageable at night).Vents are the downfall...the chin works fine, but there's not much difference in flow with the others.  Still, it kept my head cool and it didn't feel like a hurricane entered my helmet.  I used this on my Honda CB300f and my Suzuki GSXR600, it handled the upright and tucked positions wonderfully.It's pricey, but it honestly is a premium package that feels and functions according to its price.  If you can afford it, you won't regret it.\n",

      "This my second Shoei helmet and it's a bit of a disappointment. Here's why:1. The absolute worst thing about this helmet is getting it on and off my noggin. My ears get caught on the straps making it a painful affair. Probably my ears fault but still a pain nonetheless.2, Airflow is ok, best part is the front but I can't tell if the rear is open or closed as I don't feel any airflow. It would be nice to some indication of open or closed on the rear vent (I'm too lazy to read the manual)3. The helmet is quite noisy with the visor open, lots of whistle.4. The D rings are fidly, would be nice to have an optional quick release clip.5. The UK Sharp safety rating is only 4 star which is surprising for such a pricey helmet. Look up Shoei NXR rating on Sharp's website.6. Included pinlock is a nice feature and works well.So all in all, I like the helmet but the few cons irritate me.\n",

I've previously owned two older RF versions (800 and 1000, maybe?) and a Qwest, and when it was time for me to get a new helmet, I really only looked at Shoei.I love the styling of the RF1200, I am content with the fit, but it is the loudest helmet that I have ever owned and riding with the noise makes it downright unpleasant.  I am going to have to resort to earplugs under the helmet for any rides longer than 15 minutes.The next time that I have to look for a new helmet, I will broaden my search.\n",

      "I got thrown into a tank slapper at 55mph and slammed myself and my bike down on the right hand side, slid about 50ft before coming to a stop. Six broken ribs and a sprained ankle later I'm fully recovered, only because of this helmet. When I was in the ICU I kept telling everyone I kept my head up and just slid down the road. It wasn't until they brought my gear up did I realise how bad the impact was. I hit the side of my head hard and bounced back up, with the back of the helmet sliding along the ground. The paint on the entire right side behind the visor was gone. Had it been my bare head I'm sure I wouldn't still be here. I've got another one on order since Shoei said after testing mine was no longer safe for use. Besides saving my life the design is good, no major complaints other than slightly excessive wind noise, I do have a Senna headset so that may be a contributing factor to that.\n",

The RF 1200 is stable even when I turn my head for shoulder checks, etc. The venting manages the keep my head feeling cool when I am moving.  The ventilation and overall fit make this helmet exceptionally comfy.  Despite the great airflow, the noise level in the helmet is pretty quiet at highway speeds.  It is also very light.  The field of vision is excellent and I love the transitions shield I got with it.  It was a bitter pill dropping 650 to get the lid and visor, but I cried once and have never looked back.

      "A Premium Helmet\n",
      "I purchased a Shoei RF-1200 after trying one on at Cyclegear. I upgraded from an AGV K5, which has a similar base price but was purchased at a large discount. I have worn helmets for many activities, from bicycling to skateboarding to [American] Football. With regards to fit, the helmet fits perfectly on the crown and around the head for me. I noticed that my K5 Medium Large was a bit too large, and the Medium Small was a bit too small. The RF-1200 seems to be right in the middle (imagine that) and is comfortable all around. Pros+ The shell is very small. I have a size large head, and the helmet is about 75% the size of my K5 in all dimensions. + The visor fit against the seal is adjustable. I noticed my K5 had a gap between the seal and the visor that let in significant air.+ The shell is very aerodynamic. With my K5, I noticed significant torque on my neck when turning my head to check blind spots. I was amazed that I could turn my head without feeling the same torque on the RF-1200.+ The liner is extremely comfortable. + Fits my glasses very comfortably+ Vents are very easy to work with gloves+ Compatible with the photochromatic visor+ Visor is easy to removeNegatives- The ventilation on the lower portion is relatively poor. I live in Texas, and this can be a big deal in hot and humid weather.- There isn't a lot of room between the chin guard and my chin. This can be neutral, but this lead to the my glasses fogging up easily- No drop down sun shield. I never used the one on my K5, but some people really like this option. - Can be loud. Quieter than my K5, but not as quiet as I hoped. I wear earplugs anyway.- Doesn't come with a chin curtain. You can buy one separately, but I feel like this should be included.\n",

      "Bought this to replace a Shoei RF-1000. Have been using it for a little more than a year now. Good helmet, but fogs super easily. It is almost impossible to use in cold weather without the pin lock anti fog shield. Yet, the pin lock anti fog shield gets scratched easily and will cost ~$30 to replace yearly. I refrained from putting the anti fog shield during the summer months and just dealt with the fog. However, during colder months, the helmet will fog instantly in 2 seconds even with all vents open. So be prepared to crack the visor and deal with cold weather until you are 50+ mph unless if you buy the fog shield. I put on the fog shield and it worked perfectly! ... For 6 months, then it somehow got scratched or dirty even though it was on the inside of my helmet.I'm not sure if my gloves scratched it or something else, but I can't see out of it now. It has some giant spots like if I got hit by a bug and can't clean it. Need to buy a new pin lock for next winter and probably every winter.

It's comfortable, relatively quiet, light, and the optically correct face shield is incredible.  Also, airflow is excellent.  I ride behind a fairing but have a good blast of air hitting me in the face.  The venting on the helmet is so good I can feel the air move across my head.  This is my first upscale helmet and I'm kicking myself for not buying one sooner.

This Shoei is in many ways an upgraded version of that; more aggressive, better airflow, feels more solidly built. Pinlock is a great feature, and the visor overall feels very solid and durable. A couple of notes: the helmet is VERY snug when first out of the box. I followed the size chart and it still took a few weeks of regular use to break in, but now it fits like a glove.  Secondly, as other reviews note, it does have a plasticy/chemical smell for the first few weeks which is rather obnoxious. It goes away, of course, but can be a little surprising.Pricey? Yes, but this is a helmet that could potentially last you years if treated right, and may even save your life someday. I highly recommend it if you have the budget.\n",

I had a Shark Race-R previously and wanted to get in the premium category. After watching Tony's review and trying the helmet in the local dealer my thoughts were the same: Premium quality. From the shell,  the interior to the paint job (matte black and after one year it is like new, and I've ridden more than 12.000 km.) and the buckles. I don't think it can get better than that, only if you pay double, near to 1000$.Fitment:Fit is great, helmet \"broke in\" really fast and stayed like that. The interior is extra plush and comfy. I've washed it 3 times and it is like day 1.Aerodynamics:I ride a naked bike and it is really good, no headbanging whatsoever from the air.Air flow is good as well inside the shell with the vents open.I recommend this helmet to anyone thinking of getting a new helmet.

I can't believe how little I got for what I paid.The emergency cheek pads have a very hard plastic edge inside near the removable ear pieces. This hard plastic cut my ear after taking it on and off three times. If I don't stretch the base of the helmet when I take it off, I'll have a piece of my ear missing by the end of the season. I hope this doesn't crack the helmet.The breathe guard is useless, and poorly designed. It directs your hot breath back up in to your eyes. Glasses fog twice as fast with the breath guard installed. It fundamentally does not work.The added tension of the pin-lock makes the visor action too stiff. The visor moves well without the pinlock, but as soon as you install the pinlock shield the visor starts to fight you. It resists opening and changing position because the pinlock forces tension across the shield. SHOEI engineers may have made a safe and nicely shaped helmet, but they didn't try very hard at anything else here. I paid today's top dollar for 1980's technology. You fooled me this time SHOEI.

I can't describe it, but immediately after putting this helmet on and going for a ride, it's like I was locked in and in the zone (in a good way) on riding.

Sizing is spot on, although it took a while to get used to the firm cheek pads, but you can adjust those with smaller ones if you need to. I went by the size chart and it's spot on. I initially bought a medium and returned it because I thought it was too tight, so I bought a large and after wearing (inside the house) a few days, could feel it breaking in and getting way too loose. Luckily Revzilla is super cool and returns and exchanges are easy. I bought another medium and couldn't be happier. I rode in it all day on Saturday and I didn't want to come home, I just kept riding all day, it's that comfortable.  The Pinlock shield is awesome as well, no more fogging up at stop lights, it works great. Suck it up and buy it this helmet, you won't regret it. The price is worth it, you'll get quality, upgraded safety and your head will thank you.\n",

      "This is my first \"premium\" helmet.  This helmet is no better or comfortable than my HJC CL17.  Both are Snell approved, both are pinlock ready.  Comparing these two helmets side by side, and wearing them both....,there is no way to justify the 200+ dollar price difference between them.  After comparing, thoroughly thee 2 helmets...I can only come to the conclusion that people own these for status points or just for the name.  My advice, save your money, lots of it, there many other, much cheaper Snell approved lids out there.\n",

I had the AGV K3SV, which is a great helmet at its price point. I was hesitant to spend the extra money on this, as I thought how much difference could there be in helmets?Wow. After putting the helmet on, the first words out of my mouth were \"this is quality\". Everything about this lid screams quality. The fit, the finish, the paint, all of it.Goldilocks is really the perfect way to describe the helmet. Want air? Open all of the vents and it FLOWS. Want peace and quiet? Close it up. I wear the NoNoise plugs, and I could barely hear my ZX10 with a GP exhaust.The helmet is light, and very comfortable. There isn't really anything I can say that hasn't been said before, just buy this helmet.\n",

      "I am a Shoei fan, having owned only Shoei's, but tried on many others. So take this review as it is.The helmet is easy to get on and off. The visor works well and the pin lock system with fog protector does its job well. It is comfortable and not too noisy. I did have an issue once where I flipped up the visor at the lights and one side popped off. But it has never occurred since. The visor locks into place well, and provides really good wind and noise protection.The included chin curtain is virtually useless, so I only used it once, but it really isn't necessary unless you are in really cold climates. And in which case you would be wanting full neck protection rather than just chin.My only grip with the helmet is that I can't find a Bluetooth unit that really suits it. The GT-Air has a great setup with Sena built-in to the helmet, but nothing like that available for this one. The reason I didn't go with the GT-Air is that I wear prescription glasses, so having a shield, visor and glasses would have impacted the vision - IMHO. So I just use prescription sunnies (or normal glasses) and clear visor. The RF-1200 is also noticably lighter than the GT-Air.\n",

I was expecting a very bright and frankly ugly shade of yellow but was pleasantly surprised when I got it. It's easy on the eye but yet bright enough to be noticed. The fit and ventilation are good considering it's a full-faced helmet; I installed a SENA Bluetooth system and the fit is not obstructed or uncomfortable around the ears. Noise level is not bad even with all the vents open. The face shield is easy to open or exchange if you wish to do so. I highly recommend this helmet.\n",

      "This is my 4th helmet. I really wish I'd have just jumped right into this...  I'd have saved enough to get another one of these!It fits Just perfect. I've had no wiggle in any particular direction while it's on my head, and I can wear headphones under the helmet with no additional pressure on or in the ears*. Because the helmet is so much quieter than the Icon Airmada I had, I can keep it at a lower volume. That means I can be more aware of the other people on the road at all speeds.Even with all the vents open, the noise isn't excessive! speaking of vents, this is the first helmet I've had where the vents make a marked difference in how I feel air though the helmet. The breath guard does a decent job, though my glasses still fog up readily. The chin guard deflector thingy...  YES THAT'S THE TECHNICAL TERM! The chin guard deflector thing helps keep some of the air out of the helmet, reducing wind noise and, during the winter months, keeping you a bit warmer.What doesn't fog up is the pinlock insert. It's awesome, and I love it. I can bloody see during the winter time! At least as long as I'm in motion. Again, glasses are crap.The fact the anthracite grey color matches my 1190RX is just a bonus. It also responds well to pin striping...  Just saying.No, it's not as cheap as some other helmets, but what get what you pay for here!*note: I'm not advocating that you should wear headphones under your helmet. In fact, it may be illegal where you're at.\n",

I only wore a bell qualifier before this one and this is much quieter, though not by much.  I still wear earplugs to block the wind noise. There is still a little whistling if I maintain an upright position, not so much in a tucked.  I'm guessing this is more of a \"sport riding\" helmet.  Once again, I wear earplugs, so it's not an issue.  Close all the vents up in the winter and it's nice and warm.  No leakage from the visor in surprise rain showers - if only my jacket was as water proof.  Can't put a price on the protection this helmet offers and it's got more than the industry standards from what I understand.  unless you have something against the style or price, this one's a no brainer.

      "I have been riding for a long time and never thought I would say I love a full-face helmet, but this is the lid that made that happen. First, fit--I have a long oval head and it fits me perfectly in every way. That may not be the case for you so make sure you go try one on before you order one online. (I hate to say that but that is how it works in the internet world we live in!) Second, quiet--I ride a 1997 HD Road King with pipes that breath! The lid does just enough quieting my healthy pipes yet it doesn't diminish the fact I ride a bike that has character. I put a Sena sound system in the lid and it fits great and sounds like it should. Third, the PinLock System--this thing works great and keeps the fog off on cold rides--30 degrees. I will say that it does cause somewhat of a halo around lights at night but it's not bad at all. In short, I will have PinLock on every lid I have until they come out with something better. Last but not least, air flow--it's not like riding without a lid on a summer day but for a full-face brain bucket you get plenty of air on your noggin. There are a wide variety of ways to control the flow on both the front and back so experiment and tune it the way you like it. In short--I love this lid and for me it's worth the cash.\n",

      "Coming from an Icon Variant, this helmet is helmet is super compact and light. It is also pretty quiet. The vents are easy to use with a gloved hand, and have a solid/tactile feel, especially when closing. Closing the lower front vent creates a suction-y noise and everything gets a little more quiet, making me feel like I'm in my own protective bubble. The helmet gives me an overall impression that it is simplistic, and does what it's meant to do, and does it very well. I'd say the fit is slightly small, and more on the 'round side' of intermediate oval. It is a simple helmet, but you can tell the quality is top notch.\n",

      "I just got my helmet yesterday and got one 20 minute ride in cause it's freezing so mostly I kept the vents closed. First of all, I wasn't riding what the \"typical\" buyers of this helmet ride. I was on my softail which I fully intend to wear this helmet while riding. I like to look  good riding I suppose but honestly nobody but you cares what you look like riding. I used to think seatbelts looked dorky and now i feel naked without one on. I also like wind in my face but half helmets are a joke man. Get over it and think for yourself. I bought this helmet for one reason, snell approved safety for a good price. everything else came second. that being said the helmet has a lot going for it and maybe some not so much. fit was spot on by the chart. harder than hell to get squeezed over my melon and tighter than hell at first I know its got to get broken in a little but the upper half that's important fit like a true helmet should. pin lock kept the face shield clear as promised. pretty quiet being on a big twin and all but I've only had 3 full face helmets in my life and this is my first shoei. quieter than my old bell for sure and I loved that helmet. chin guard or curtain thing is a joke I think. breath guard was OK but added a little claustrophobia to the helmet. venting is the only thing I wish I could speak more of but can't because I haven't used it. feels safe as hell, looks decent in matte black, cheaper than many, and I don't smoke so I wouldn't give $200 more for a modular because I don't stand around with my helmet on. when I get off, I take it off like everybody else I see. I think for snell approved safety and top end quality I've hit a home run with this one. Hope I never test it out against the pavement, but if I do I've got a much better chance of telling about it later than my pals in half helmets.\n",

I received the helmet the day before the trip, thanks to overnight shipping from Revzilla, so there was no break-in time. The helmet is a snug fit; I bought a Medium with a 23 3/4\" head measurement which is on the high side of the Shoei measurement guide for a Medium. The airflow is decent and the vents are easy to control with gloves on. The noise level is low, but surrounding noise (cagers and bike stereo) can still be heard.

I was shocked at the difference on the highway between the 1100 and the 1200.  Such a pleasant surprise.  The RF 1200 elmainated any of the head wobble at high speeds.  Even when turning my head side to side, the air moves smoothly over the helmet.  I find this to be a big improvement over the RF 1100.I am extremely satisfied with the Shoei RF 1200.

What really is there to say that the video doesn't, other than the little things. The shield has a \"Visor Adjustment Dial\" to make the shield form tighter around the seal, it comes with silicone oil for the shield gasket, the cheek pads have grooves by the snaps so they do not shift, the ear cut outs snap into place and have a soft flap reducing acoustic issues. the pinlock posts on the outside of the shield are smooth and have a aerodynamic profile, the shield gear are made of carbon chin curtain is honeycombed for ventilation and help reduce wind noise as well as inside turbulence, the breath guard is low profile and made from rubber this reduces the risk if cuts and broken nose from a frontal impact, etc... I could go on but I will leave the rest for YOU to discover as you look over the single most important item among your safety gear.

I bought it in matte black now just need to throw on a blacked out visor and I'm set. I'm very happy with my new helmet and would definitely recommend this product to new and experienced riders.\n",

      "This review is for the Matte Black RF1200 size medium.This helmet includes all of the features one could want from a helmet out of the box; independent brow and breathe vent, chin curtain, a pinlock capable shield, pinlock insert, washable/replaceable eps liners, (that are also available in different sizes) and replacement visors. I chose this product not only because of the features listed above, but also because Shoei tends to support their helmets (i.e. selling replacement parts) for a long time. The fit feels spot on, no hotspots, field of view is super wide, and wind noise is moderate. The best helmets are the ones that disappear from your consciousness and the RF-1200 definitely does that, even on short rides.There is only a couple of negatives about the helmet. First, would be the matte black finish, it scratches way too easily and I baby this helmet. If you are interested in the matte black I would recommend the standard black instead since scratches could stand to be buffed out on the standard black. Second, replacement visors are expensive especially mirrored or photo-chromatic. This helmet provides great value for a mid-high range helmet.\n",

After watching the RevZilla video and reading reviews, I was expecting it to be quieter than it is: with all the vents open, it's louder than my old cheap helmet - but the airflow is also much better, so I guess that's the trade-off.\n",

      "My third Shoei, RF1200 is an excellent helmet\n",
      "My 7yr old X-12 was beginning to get noisy through the air vents, and the padding was wearing, so time for something new. Shoei has always fit my head perfectly, nice and snug with no tight-spots, and the quality, fit & finish is beyond compare so I was definitely staying with the brand. I looked closely at the X-14, but a_ couldn't justify the additional cost over the RF b) don't really care for the all-out aero look and c) the RF had a metallic black to match my 2014 ZX-14R.Worn the helmet on three rides so far. Fit is perfect, eyeglasses slide into channels with no problem. Others complain about the chinstrap, it's standard Shoei and I have no problem with it. I always wear earplugs no matter the helmet, this helmet has about the same wind noise level as the X-12 when at speed, i.e. quite tolerable.Aerodynamically, the RF stays in place, no lifting or other adverse movements when looking over the shoulder. The pinlock system works perfectly, the shield is solidly in place and ratchets up and down, easy to remove and install. Around town in warm weather, I keep the shield slightly open, and the mechanism holds it in place with no problem up to 70 mph or so at which point I close it.Overall a good value for a quality lid.\n",

      "The helmet surprised me, as I had worn 1/2 helmets before. Did not like the idea of being closed up. Thought I would loose a lot of ride enjoyment. That has not been the case. Actually like riding in it.It does reverberate the exhaust sound from the Krome Werks pipes.At highway speeds the wind noise is minimal. If you turn your head, there is some drag felt. Straight though, no buffeting.Great helmet, but expensive.\n",

      "Love this Helmet - Great on Track\n",
      "I have absolutely loved having this helmet. I'm about a year in now and have no real complaints. It's a stunning looking helmet for sure. The multiple size shells mean that this helmet looks very streamlined and won't make you look like a bobble-head. You get a helmet much closer in size to your actual head than a cheap helmet.I stepped up to this from my starter helmet which was the cheapest Bell you could buy so the differences are remarkable. The RF-1200 is noticeably lighter, quieter, offers better airflow, and has a much more form-fitting shell. This helmet also offers a wonderfully wide field of view but note that the pinlock system does not reach to the far edges of the visor. The biggest advantage, however, is the way the helmet cuts through the air. My old Bell buffeted horribly at anything above 70 mph; the Shoei is remarkably stable up to about 90 mph where some slight buffeting occurs.The inclusion of a pinlock system in this helmet is an added bonus and super necessary for any cold or humid riding.I highly recommend spending the \"extra\" money to get this amazing helmet.\n",

      "I bought this helmet based on the Revzilla review videos and am not disappointed. It feels substantial and lightweight at the same time. It's a comfortable fit, and quiet with the visor down - excellent airflow, too. It does whistle with the visor up at speeds over 35 mph, but I haven't played with all the venting yet to see if I can offset it. I've been riding on 85+ deg days and have been comfortable riding with this helmet. I would highly recommend.\n",

      "Came out of a Biltwell Bonanza and love the open air-ness of a 3/4 helmet but after a run end with a Chevy I mangled my face. Decided to step it up to a top quality full face and I tell you what this helmet is the bee's knees. Just as light if not lighter than the biltwell, air flows through it like a full face but still cooling considering. It has a lot of vents, some I didn't even know about. I wondered why there was instructions for a helmet. The helmet does fit a little tight around the cheeks but I figure it will wear in, if it doesn't I can order new pads. Very cool. I wear sunglasses and since it's tight it was quite interesting putting them on. I can't wait until the transition lenses are available again because that and communications will be the next purchase. Hight recommended and thanks to Revzilla for wonderful descriptions, videos, and fast shipping.\n",

      "This is my first helmet so I didn't really have anything to compare it to long term.I initially took the cheek pads out to make room for my bluetooth which loosened the fit, but also let in a lot of wind noise. After I figured out that I could put the cheek pads in with my Sena the noise level dropped significantly and is great on the highway at higher speeds. The helmet fits ok out the box. The cheek pads are too big for my face, so I had to order a different set. It would be great if you had that option when ordering the helmet instead of it being an extra cost. Airflow is great. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the speaker holes are to small for my bluetooth speakers. As a result the speakers sit on the pads in the helmet and sometimes irritate my ears. This is probably more of the bluetooth manufacturers issue, but if the speaker pockets were a little bigger it would be better.\n",

Chose Revzilla and was even more pleased I had, after receiving the helmet in 3 days. No special freight selected, just clicked the free shipping choice.

      "This helmet was tried on at another retailer. Found that it fit tight, but not too tight. My head measurement is 58.5 cm so the large I ordered fit perfectly. Initially, the noise level was louder than I thought it should probably be, but I figured out why. After putting on the helmet, I would just flip the shield down, thinking it was closed.(have been a half-helmet rider for about 20 years) Well, after coming back from a ride and cleaning the shield, I realized that to close it fully, it takes a little extra pressure to get the bottom of the shield over a small \"locking\" indent at the lower-left rim of the face opening. Noise concern was alleviated on next ride. Airflow is great - head was comfortable during hour long ride in 90° heat and high humidity. Will probably buy Shoei again when this one wears out.\n",

      "Firstly, this is my second helmet. I bought it to replace my Shoei TZ-R, which I bought in 2011, so that's what I can compare it to. I ride in rush hour traffic on city streets 6 days a week on my 2015 CBR300RA, about 15 minutes each way. I usually don't go faster than about 50mph on my commute because that's what limits and traffic allow. I've also done several long highway and freeway rides with this helmet. Compared to the TZ-R it's certainly lighter and tighter. It's not uncomfortable, but i'm going to use my Zillacash toward the 31mm cheek pads. I worry a little that if (when) I crash that the right hit might cause my teeth to chomp a good bit out of the inside of my cheeks, hence the decision to move to the smaller pads. The airflow in this helmet is pretty darn good. It's much better than the TZ-R. the noise isn't an issue until you're up at 70mph or faster. It doesn't bother me much. I'm happy to take better airflow for a bit more noise, but that's just me. My favorite thing about this helmet is how light and comfortable it is. The only thing is the cheekpads, and I'll try to update once I try the new ones. If other reviews are any guide, it'll be a nice improvement for my individual fit.\n",

      "Nice overall but very loud\n",
      "Having owned several Shoei models, I settled on the RF1200 to replace my current helmet. The classic shape and overall design are very similar to the RF1100. The comfort and fit is also what I've come to expect from their productsPros: Wind drag and weight are very negligible even at high speeds. The redesigned visor and ratchet system have been beefed up and provide more solid operation and less vibration (especially when riding with the visor open). The modified interior chin area and reduced weight are also notable improvements. Field of vision is good.Cons: Very loud. Even with the visor sealed, the wind noise is considerably louder than the RF1100 (this is particularly relevant on cruiser or non-fairing bikes where the rider's chin is raised). The new ratchet design also deletes the visor \"lock\" system which was useful in conditions where the visor was prone to fogging. The visor is not interchangeable with earlier models.Overall, I'm happy with the improvements developed in the RF1200 and would recommend it for most riders. If it were not for the noise level, I would easily rate this a 5 star product.\n",

I found out the hard way; with some modifications (took off the plastic housing on the SMH10R speakers), they fit nicely. 5. Matte black is sexy.6. The helmet arrived in one-day even though I didn't ask for one-day shipping. Shoutouts to Revzilla.\n",

The size chart worked perfectly for me and I was able to order the right size the first time.I trust the Snell and DOT rating and hope I never have to get the firsthand experience. You already know Revzilla will get it to you yesterday. Visors are available and switching them is easy as well. I gave a 4/5 for features since there are a good amount of air intakes and the capability to have electronic equipment on it but no pre-installed tech on the helmet.\n",

I've typically ridden with a three-quarters helmet but as I continue to ride harder (and drivers behave more aggressively) I want the increased protection of full face. The RF-1200 delivers it without feeling like I've strapped a load of bricks to my head. Venting works very well (the front vent is a little noisy so I keep it closed). Added bonus is a reasonable price point. A real value, in my opinion.\n",

      "I have owned several helmets in this price range. So, my review is based upon what I have experienced in comparison to other brands. I ride in the upright position, sometimes a 3/4 tuck. The good:The RF1200 looks great, is very light, and offers little wind resistance at speed. It cuts through the air nicely and does not jerk my head around when I'm looking over my shoulder at high speed. I personally do not experience any fogging unless it is cold out. Even then, it is minimal and only when I stop. I haven't felt the need to install the pinlock lens yet. I'm assuming it will work as well as all the other lenses out there? The air-flow is good, and all the vents are closable if desired. The removable chin-curtain and breath guard are nice touches and work well. The shield stays where you put it. You don't have to worry about it popping up or down unexpectedly. And, the helmet has excellent safety ratings. So, I like that peace-of-mind.The bad:The RF1200 cheek pads are ridiculously tight and the helmet itself is unforgiving. It seems after a month of use that there has been very little \"forming\" to my head. I have no problem with other helmets but this thing is in a league of its own. It makes me wonder if Shoei does this intentionally so you are forced to buy smaller cheek pads and head-liners. Which, when you do, are also tight. And yes, I have the proper fit and used the recommended size chart. The helmet is fairly loud at speed. It helps a bit if you close all the vents. But, if rushing wind-noise bothers you, you will need ear-plugs. With the shield up, the helmet whistles loudly at plus 40mph. I find this very annoying. The piece of material that serves as a type of pad under the chin-straps is practically worthless. It feels super cheap, thin, and moves all around.Overall, it's a good helmet. But, I expected more for the money. Shoei, should either correct the issues or considerably lower the cost.Arai, is still my favorite.\n",

      "Great Helmet - if it fits you - Noise is relative to bike\n",
      "It was time to replace my five year old helmet for a number of reasons. Among my criteria were cost, fit, features & noise level.In terms of the noise level, I was surprised that there was so much disparity in people's evaluation of this helmet. I thought maybe people were wearing the wrong size or the helmet shape was not the best for their head.Since I basically always wear foam earplugs regardless, I decided to place less weight on the noise evaluations in other reviews.I also decided fit was paramount.I tried this one on, as well as helmets by a number of other manufacturers. I kept coming back to this one feeling it was the most comfortable for my head shape.I had the good fortune to be trying it on while the Shoei rep was in the store and she explained a number of differences in shape and features between this and other Shoei helmets as well as other manufacturer's helmets.One of aspects that I remember is that she said this helmet was designed with sport bike riders in mind while the Qwest was designed for those who ride in a more upright position. I ride a sport touring bike so the Qwest is probably better suited to my riding style but I liked the RF-1200 better so I bought it.Once I got back on the highway to ride home from the store, I thought \"yeah, this is loud\". I played around with the vents a little and found the chin vent had the biggest impact on the amount of noise. I also wondered if it would be quieter with the chin skirt on which I have yet to use.Later, during my ride, I stood on the pegs for a bit while still on the highway. I was shocked ... the noise level decreased significantly. I was so surprised, I've tried it a couple of times since; both at highway speeds and at rural road speeds. Sitting down it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel; standing up it's much quieter. I'm guessing this must have something to do with the design of the helmet (for sport bike riders with little wind protection) and that when I ride I'm behind a windscreen creating different air patterns over the helmet.So, now I'm curious ... are all those that complained it's loud behind a windscreen while those who claim it's quiet have little wind protection?In conclusion, for me, the cost is in line with the fit, quality and features. As for the noise level ... not as quiet as I was hoping for; but, I'm resigned to the fact that it's my own doing by purchasing a helmet that was designed for a different riding style and position. Nothing a cheap set of foam earplugs won't rectify.Hope this helps\n",

      "I purchased the RF-1200 a month ago and have little to no complaints. The fit is a skosh snug, but I have a lot of hair and even more cheeks, so I feel this is more of a personal problem.To counter the reviews complaining of wind noise, I've actually been surprised by the lack of noise. With the shield down at highway speeds it's very quiet, and you can really notice the aerodynamics allowing your head to easily stay in normal riding position.About the venting, at first I might have agreed with some reviews saying that the ventilation is weak, especially given the price tag of the helmet. But after riding around in the misery known as Oklahoma, my head has yet to feel hot, even with the matte black finish. I guess folks expect to feel a blast of air rushing over their head when they open the vents, and when they don't, they assume the vents are flawed. The helmet is venting, and venting well, it's just not a noticeable process.\n",

I love that it is perfectly setup for my sena, & easy enough to mount a gopro too. Fit is perfect, vision is perfect, super lightweight, wind noise is minimal. My only con is the airflow. I haven't had too many helmets in the past, comparing it to my most recent helmet the Bell Bullitt (anything & everything has better airflow than that lol), I just feel like there's not enough airflow to my noggin on 90+ degree days.

      "Expensive helmet with many flaws\n",
      "I purchased this helmet to replace my old Arai Quantum II. By the time I found out about all the problems, it was too late to return. First the good. The face shield is very nice. Easy to take on and off, and the detents are nice and firm allowing riding with the shield up. Excellent shield. Now the bad. Padding top: First, every Shoei has the same interior padding flaws. There are three strips of padding over the crown of your head. One over the top and two on either side oriented front to back. Unfortunately, the middle padding strip takes the full load of the helmet weight. Being bald after riding there was a huge dent in my scalp where the center padding strip lies on the very top of my head (yes, my head shape is quite normal). I added bike helmet padding to the side strips so the weight would be more evenly distributed between all three pads which helped somewhat. Arai has an oval pad that goes around your crown, which distributes the helmet weight more effectively. Padding front: The front of the padding is attached on the leading edge of the helmet shell. The problem with this is that the padding liner droops onto your eyebrows causing a feeling of sagging material over your forehead. You can push your fingers on the padding lining and see that it's not taught and sags a bit. You can kind of tuck the liner under your scalp using your fingers, but it eventually comes loose and sags over your eyebrows again. Arai has a \"skull cap\" interior padding design that doesn't hang down onto your face. Padding sides: This helmet is squeezes your head hard and the foam is not forgiving or comfortable. I eventually purchased the thinner padding, but it still wasn't enough to provide enough comfort beyond maybe a hour or two. Riding all day left me with a headache from the constant squeezing of my cheekbones. Strap: The helmet strap has a long (maybe 2\") extra material presumably to prevent chafing of the strap web against your skin. Unfortunately, it's not attached to the strap webbing and it just flops to the side and provides no protection for which is was designed. Venting: The helmet venting is very weak at best with hardly any airflow. There really is nothing about this Shoei helmet justifying the high cost. If you charge a premium price, then the details matter. Getting another Arai, which is what I should have done in the first place.\n",

      "I purchased the Shoei RF-1200 as a much-needed upgrade to my Fulmer starter helmet. Originally I had wanted to avoid buying a helmet online, as I was leery of doing a sizing-shuffle. In the end I took some measurements and the sizing charts were pretty spot-on; the helmet fits great. The helmet construction is fairly light and the padding is excellent; this is a comfortable helmet to wear. Built in grooves allow for a pair of aviator sunglasses without any pain points. There are several air vents, and the airflow is noticeable, which is a big plus for someone who rides year round in Arizona. The only negative aspect I've found so far is the level of noise with the air-vents open is higher than I anticipated, but that's nit-picky considering it is more quiet than my previous helmet.\n",

Medium size helmet fit me perfectly - I'm about 6'1'' 175lbs and of european origin (not sure if this makes a difference).After riding with a helmet for a few minutes, I forget that it's even on me - ventilation is great and I can feel the wind moving around my head; over-shoulder head checks are easy as the helmet doesn't interfere and feels very light.Unfortunately I cannot really compare this to other helmets, but this was a great buy nevertheless.\n",

If you're riding in cold weather, expect to keep your visor open, so get a balaclava that covers your nose. I've had other brand name helmets that did not have this issue. It would also be nice to be able to keep the visor popped open just a tiny bit more (or less) -- most helmets don't seem to hit this sweet spot.\n",

If you wear contacts you can experience some definite dry eyes with this.The pinlock is a godsend and I still like this helmet more than my Scorpion, but it has flaws.\n",

      "I've been enjoying hair by Shoei for more than two decades now. I have a round head and a size large Shoei fits perfectly. My last three helmets were X-12s. I opted for the RF-1200 over the X-14 because my riding has changed from track days and higher speeds to more sport touring. The X series are racing helmets and sacrifice ease of off and on and a little quietness for more stability at high speeds. The RF is much easier to put on and take off...your ears can actually stay in place. It is also slightly less noisy but flows a little less air than the X-12. Like the X series, the RF is plush and comfortable and can be custom sized by changing cheek pads. The eye opening is cut a bit higher than the X-12 and I added some tape on the shield as a sun visor. Unfortunately my spare CW-1 face shields will not fit the RF-1200...same issue with the X-14. I'm happy with my chose and looking forward to some years of easy living with the RF-1200.\n",

      "First and foremost, I'm 5 days out from a nasty highside coming out of turn 5 at Barber Motorsports Park... I don't remember it. I just remember waking up at UAB Hospital that night with literally every square inch of my body in pain. Witnesses say I landed on my back with the back of my head whipping onto the pavement. Well, I'm alive, and though I'm concussed, I don't think you can ask for more from a helmet. Protecting your brain in 80mph crashes when you practically land head first is a tall order, and this helmet delivered.I didn't originally buy this for the track. My initial purchase decision was due to having to live with a cheap helmet beforehand. Like most things, helmets are more than just the sum of their parts. You can have less than perfect aerodynamics and you won't really notice the difference of a few more ounces of wind pressure with your head turned. Or, you may not notice the 5dB difference in wind noise... until you have to ride with it for months on end. This is why I looked toward the top shelf with this Shoei. Its easy to don and doff with the chinstrap through the loops, and with practice(though not recommended, blah blah blah) its pretty easy to use with headphones in.I've always appreciated this helmet for its features and felt that it was worth the price, but after last Saturday I'm a Shoei guy for life!

In the meantime I'm rocking my friend's RF-1200 in matte black. Have ridden one trackday with it and about 300 street miles. In a word, wow. No wonder it has 600+ positive reviews. Venting is great, the liner is super comfortable, no lift at speed, stable, no buffeting, no head pull when lane checking. In otherwords, all the benefits of the X-14 but half the price AND lighter(check the pic). If you are thinking about the X-14, keep that extra cash in your wallet and get this one instead.

It is a familiar fit and finish that I was looking for. Sizing is very consistent. The helmet is not overly heavy and feels more aerodynamic in the upright riding position than the RF-1000. Peripheral vision in this helmet is excellent and airflow it top notch. Since the airflow is so excellent I had expected this helmet to be a bit noisier than the RF-1000 and that was confirmed.

I have a long shaped face from forehead to chin and I first off noticed that I found my chin to come out past the chin bar a bit. It's a very shallow feeling helmet.  I've owned many helmets. Last being an icon airmada. Here are my two major gripes with the rf1200.  The chin strap. The padding that's attached to the D ring and belt are disappointing. They don't lay properly between your face and the strap plus very thin and flimsy. The snap is up inside the lid making it very hard to snap with gloves on. The airmada was great in that area.  The liner above the eybrows moves a lot. It bunches up if you don't put the lid on exactly right. That area was solid on my airmada.  Looks killer and feels comfortable. Wind noise not soo bad.  For near $500 just expected a bit more quality. I feel I got better quality with my $200 icon.  I do like the helmet overall.  I do like revzilla!\n",

The style and finish of this helmet is top notch. This is the best looking helmet I've owned. Vision is fantastic with a wide visor opening. The chin strap and slack button are sub par.  What kills this helmet is the wind noise. I understand that any helmet that has good airflow will have noise. That is the trade off, I have read many comments from R1200 owners here about the noise. I honestly profiled them as novice riders who don't realize that every helmet that flows air will have some noise. After all, this is Shoei and there flagship helmet. I was wrong. You must wear earplugs with this helmet. How anyone can use an intercom or Bluetooth with this helmet is beyond me. I wish I had went with a new Bell Star because the airflow, fit/finish, and price is much better.  I must include that Revzilla was Revzilla. Outstanding and quick service.

I went from a cheaper modular type helmet to this one. My intention is to eventually take it out for my first track day. I strongly believe that you get what you pay for and this helmet is a prime example of that. As long as my head doesn't grow any larger I hope to be able to use this helmet for years to come.\n",

      "Styling: I love the shape of the shell and how compact it looks. It doesn't get too dirty, and days that it does it's pretty easy to clean. Vision is excellent thanks to the wide eye port. It looks aerodynamic and in the matte black it looks like a stealth fighter.Quality: The materials are topnotch and feel topnotch. It definitely feels like its a helmet that will last. All the liners firmly snap into place.Features: Out of the box it comes with a pilnlcok visor, ear pads, a breath guard and a chin curtain. It has everything you need. I was able to buy the photochromic face shield and I love it. It eliminate that need for a drop down visor. It can't handle direct sunlight but not very many tinted visors can without impeding on visibility.Comfort: I love the snug fit. It helps with the noise and moves with your head when you do head checks. I bought a size small shell and replace the cheek pads with the 31mm replacements pads and it fits my noggin' much better now. The only problem is my ear sticks out and the pads put pressure on my ear lobe. Removing the ear pads helped in this regard. The only other problem I had with it it my ear snags on the plastic edge of the cheek pad when I remove the helmet. I may have to DIY the **** out of the cheek pad to help with that.It's not a cheap helmet by any means so like any helmet purchase, it's better you try it on prior to pulling the trigger on buying it. Keep it on your head and feel for pressure points on your head and ears. Put it on and take it off a couple of times and see how that feels too.4 stars\n",

      "Great upgrade from the hjc cl-17\n",
      "I'm a new-ish rider and decided to pick up a new helmet so I could have one for myself and one for a passenger. It was a bit on the expensive end for me (coming from an HJC CL-17) but the reviews were so awesome I couldn't pass it up - in the end, I'd say it's well worth the price.Compared to the HJC this helmet is a huge improvement. When I originally helmet shopped in person in stores the employees at multiple locations told me there was no big improvement over the CL-17 and this Shoe, that it was basically a brand name thing and some added functionality. They must not have ever tried this helmet on because there is a massive difference in weight (much lighter), size (smaller), vision (much wider) and ventilation (better and more options). Plus, there is an included pin lock shield for anti-fogging (I'd have to crack the hjc if it was a bit chilly). Perhaps the biggest difference was the noise level, I hadn't realized how much my ears were dealing with in the HJC until I switched. Now it's nice a quiet (at least relatively).As I said, I'm a new rider and haven't worn many helmets. However, I do know that this helmet is well worth the price as an upgrade if you're looking to replace something in the $150 range.\n",

      "I have owned numerous helmets from multiple manufacturers including the more race oriented helmet from Shoei, the X-12. In short, this is the most comfortable and quietest helmet I have owned. While the X-12 was just as comfortable and maybe slightly lighter (though not noticeably), the RF-1200 is near silent in clean air.I ordered a large and had to get smaller pads as the helmet was too tight, which was expected. XL's with larger pads are slightly too big for me still. Though if you plan to put any speakers for a headset in the helmet, I would recommend going with the larger helmet and larger pads if it will fit properly.\n",

      "I've got a 22 inch circumference head and went with the small. My head shape profile fits the helmet well but holy jeebus is it tight! I mean that in a good way. After breaking it in, it fits PERFECT. It is difficult to get onto my head with the chin curtain and takes me multiple tries with my elephant ears (I am a man with odd proportions) to get it on without my ears being folded, which is ok for a man with elephant ears. I honestly would totally expect it to work fully without the chin strap if I were to test it. All that being said, the Shoei website says to stretch out the helmet using the chinstraps so there's that.The chin strap is comfortable and tight (in nothing but good ways) and doesn't crush my gigantic (seriously, mine's bigger) adam's apple so you bros w/ giant adam's apples are gonna be ok.The pinlock visor is kind of a pain. It's my first pinlock so this might be inexperience but I messed up the installation so now a corner of the notch in the pinlock is bent. Still works perfectly. Tried to fog it in 40F rain with vents closed and breathing stupidly, couldn't.One thing they don't tell you is that this visor is to be oiled (not at the joints). This is weird to me but w/e. They say to use very little, THEY MEAN IT. A couple drops goes a long way, use a cloth to spread it out.There is NO leakage for me even in heavy rain.Ok, noise for this helmet is weird. You have to face forward to reduce noise with this helmet, instead of looking down. That being said, it's not too quiet. I wouldn't recommend more than 15 minutes @ 75 mph.The wine red color has a good sparkle to it, very, very small flakes and the image does it perfect justice in the color.\n",

Bought the RF1200 and it was just what I needed for more sporty riding. Initially I wanted a lighter helmet than the RF1200, but that meant spending pretty big bucks. I was surprised though when I put on this helmet; it is balanced so well that it feels lighter than it is, and it isn't a real heavy helmet to begin with. Great field of view and air flow.\n",

The pinlock works like a charm. No fogging whatsoever. It felt a bit snug but after only 3 rides it already starts to feel better. It's as quiet as the scorpion.

      "I have always had Shoei helmets as I love the quality, features, and looks. I had to buy a new helmet as I crashed on the race track and had to replace my old Shoei. I cannot say enough about Shoei's helmet check service as they are quick to scan the helmet and get it back to you after a crash. The first time it happened they checked it and everything was okay so it did not have to be replaced, however that was not the case with the latest one. Each time my head was well protected so it was no doubt that I was going to go with a Shoei again. The only issue I had with fit was the cheek pads were too tight. I bought the thinner cheek pads and made the fit perfect all the way around. This helmet replaced my old RF-1100 and really enjoy how much quieter this helmet is as I use it for both track and commuting purposes. It also has much better air flow so overall I am happy with this upgrade. I also use a communicator on my helmet and was able to install with little trouble. The chin bar is closer than the RF-1100 so the mic is so close that if you move your mouth around you may rub up against it. It is not a big deal, but something to be aware of.\n",

      "Ive tried the RS1, the RPHA and the EXO 1100. Ive also had the opportunity to ride a GT Air for long period of time (friend let me try it). The Shoei immediately feels like a higher quality product, the visor snaps down in a solid way, the RPHA and RS1 feel- in comparison- the air vent switches are loose and the visor mechanism feels flimsier. The RF1200 is the smallest helmet out of all 4 others mentioned above. As a matter of fact, I use a medium and the RPHA in a small is actually slightly larger in size than the RF1200 in med. I was very fortunate to get a 7/15 production date, and my model includes the newest pinlcok EVO. It gives about an extra half inch of vision on either side, the locking tab that's on the visor is positioned further back and the pinlock itself is wider. Wonderful. The GT Air I used for about 6 months had the older pinlock and its immediately noticeable. Great helmet, fits a bit snug compared to the mediums of the other 3 helmets above, the RPHA was huge, I could take a small. The Scorpion was a bit too comfortable, that's not good, a bit tight is what you want. Perfect helmet for my head, its small, looks great, that cutaway at the neck looks cool in addition to cutting weight, and everything is tight and feels high quality. I love this helmet, nothing bad to say. Helmet is made in Japan.\n",

I'm getting minor cauliflower ears :(And also, I got a small but if there's heavy wind mixed with riding highway = helmet moves. It doesn't move a lot but definitely not suppose to be tossed up by the wind through the chin side.The vision is excellent :) I just wished it fit my head better...

      "I can't leave a review for this product without first acknowledging the incredible support and customer service I received from Ethan and Jon @ RZ. I'm a new rider and first time helmet buyer, and they answered all of my questions, looked at photos of my head shape, and provided valuable input in the decision making process. I was considering a few helmets (Bell Star, Arai Signet-Q, among others) before choosing this RF-1200, and though it is still less than a month old - I have no regrets. But, I was overwhelmed at first with how many choices there were...I ordered the SM and MD because my head size is 56cm Intermediate Oval, and that puts me right in the middle of the two sizes. Out of the box, the MD was much more comfortable. But after watching several videos, reading many sizing guides, and asking a ton of questions, I realized that the SM was a better (read: safer) fit. My skin moved with the helmet when I moved it, I couldn't touch the chin bar to my chin, I couldn't slide the helmet off, etc. After a few days, the firmness of the liner and cheek pads has given a little, and the fit is comfortably snug.My ratings above may be skewed since I have no comparison, but here's my logic: BANG - Shoei is a top quality brand, and this is one of their top helmets. The quality and features are commensurate with helmets from other brands that go for hundreds more. STYLE - sporty without being aggressively race oriented and classic without looking like a bubble head. COMFORT - answered that above. It IS snug at first, but it is incredibly comfortable once the interior starts to break in a bit. PROTECTION - hopefully I never have to experience this firsthand, but again, everything I heard and read suggests it's top notch, SNELL 2015 and DOT-certified too. AIRFLOW - seems decent, but I haven't been on too many rides at speed yet. There are plenty of accessible vents though. FEATURES - I like the idea of the emergency cheekpad release system, but again, I hope I never have to use it. NOISE LEVEL - This is my first helmet and my first bike. I'm used to riding road cycles and hitting the drops at 40mph is loud. I have no benchmark, but the Shoei definitely makes it quieter than wearing nothing!\n",

      "I have been riding for about 3 years (14,000 miles) and my first two helmets were Scorpion, EXO-400 and then an EXO-1100.My EXO-400 had a nice design, but would start hurting the sides of my head within 30 minutes to an hour of riding. The EXO-1100 had nice features, but was a tad bit loud and heavy enough to hurt my neck after short rides.I finally decided to bite the bullet and go with an entry level premium helmet. I can honestly say I have never been more pleased with a purchase.Immediately, I noticed the weight difference and it felt like a complete even fit around my entire head, with no tightness on only parts of my head. On the warmer days, I have felt the air flowing through the top of the helmet, keeping my scalp cool, and enough wind to keep my face cool as well. The features of this helmet (emergency release, Pinlock ready - even includes the pinlock, etc. are awesome.I would have to say my ONLY gripe about this helmet are the speaker holes. They are pre-cut, however, they are so defined that if your speakers are not an exact fit, they are going to be crooked and press against your ears. I have the uClear HBC200, and even had the guys at Cycle Gear attempt to install the speakers in a manner than wouldn't hurt. I finally decided to give up on my blue tooth once it ended up splitting my ear open when I tried to remove my helmet. (The pressure against the top of my ear + sweat + sliding off the helmet caused it to stick and pull skin off). I have seen modifications made to this helmet by other wearers that cut the plastics on the inside to make their bluetooth fit, but I am not willing to alter the helmet and possibly risk damaging the integrity for blue tooth capabilities.Hands down, amazing helmet, highly recommended for any rider looking to go from an entry level helmet to a premium!\n",

The vents work fantastic, I usually keep some of them opened, so I've never been able to test how quiet the helmet can get with them all closed.My only complaint is that their white doesn't perfectly match the pearl white my Ninja is, but no one's looking that closely at my head anyways, right?\n",

The helmet delivered in the looks and build quality department. Unfortunately, I have a head that is oval-shaped, which I found out after wearing the helmet and getting a painful hot spot on my forehead. Revzilla recommended going to a the 5mm center pad (the helmet comes with a 9mm pad), which alleviated some, but not all of the pain. (After 20 minutes of riding, I still had a sore, red spot on the middle of my forehead.) The vents in the helmet are ok - I couldn't really tell if it was flowing a lot of air. Also, the visor tends to whistle when it's fully raised and you're riding anywhere over 30 m.p.h. I ordered a medium, which was snug on my 23'' head. If I had a round or slight oval head, I'd be keeping this helmet. As it stands, I'll be selling it at a loss, and trying the Arai Signet-Q that I've ordered.\n",

      "Great all round helmet.\n",
      "I've had all kinds of brands of helmets. My first helmet was a Shoei RF-1000. Back then, the RF-1000 didn't feel 'premium'. It was more of an entry level helmet. A helmet that paves the way to better, higher spec lids. Anything below an RF-1000 was junk.Enter the RF-1200. It's a great all rounder for every day wear. You can tour, do trackdays, cruise, whatever your heart pleases with this helmet. Built quality is top notch. Easily leagues above the older models. It feels very solid. Tolerances are tight. Dare I say, it's close to the same build quality as an Arai, if not the same build quality. It's overbuilt. Crazy overbuilt. I could barely flex this thing. It's a solid shell.Paint quality is wonderful. So much so that I wish my bike had the same paint quality as the RF-1200. It's nice and thick. Painted like a German car.Fit is great, but that's very subjective. My head fits most helmets except for the extreme shapes. No hotspots. No pressure points. Nothing too tight. Nothing too loose. It fits just right. The fabric and padding are quite comfortable as well.Ventilation is great. I have a lot of race replica helmets. Those only vent effectively when in the full tuck position. The RF-1200 vents in any position which is great. I can feel the air on the top of my head, which is a nice. Sound wise, it's noticeable quieter than any of my race replicas, but I would still wear hearing protection due to wind noise.Field of vision is also quite nice. Not AGV Corsa wide, but wide enough. The clarity of the face shield insanely clear. Probably the clearest I have ever seen through. I have the dark smoke, and good lord, it's so clear!Weight wise, it's about average. Lighter than most on the market. But not as light as a race replica.Overall, the RF-1200 is the jack-of-all trades in the market. It does everything well, and generally does nothing wrong. Price-wise, it definitely has increased since the RF-1000 days, but what you get is a helmet that has been moved up to the premium stage. This helmet should be everyone's every day helmet.\n",

Looks great and more than comfy for longer rides. Very aerodynamic, decently light and super quiet.I'm a 58cm head, right on the cusp of med/large so I got the medium. It's a perfect fit if only a bit snug and I assume it'll break in and loosen just a tad. Would definitely recommend it!\n",

Air flow seems much better and the visor locking mechanism is much better. The chin vents really moves air across the visor to keep it fog free. Out of the box I took it on a 3,000 road trip on the West coast and it performed excellently. Definitely quieter than the RF-1000, I did all day rides at or above 60mph with no ear plugs, which is something I couldn't do with the RF-1000.\n",

I wish there was a more budget friendly high cut lid out there, but I was not able to find one. Air flow is decent, the Scorpion seemed to have better, but it is not a hot box by any means. It also comes with only a clear shield, which is fine, if you don't ride during the day...\n",

      "I've worn Shoei's RF series for many years, they just keep getting better and better. The RF1200 has carried forward all the good aspects of the previous generations, and improved again in key areas. The new shell is much stronger feeling while being significantly lighter, and fits snugger, but is even more comfortable. The new visor is extremely strong and flex-free thanks to the new structural beads, and the ventilation while not improved IMO is equally as good as the RF100 was.I had a cheekpad construction issue, which the glorious team at Revzilla dealt with incredibly quickly. I received a response to my initial email with 30 minutes, and after several pictures were sent, they had a free replacement in the mail within 24 hours. Awesome service!

I noticed the shape also create less drag when checking over my shoulder when changing lanes, on a naked bike like I have buffeting can be an issue. I haven't installed my pinlock yet, the ventilation works very well to clear up any fog inside the visor and allows me to adjust the temperature inside fir different riding condition.

I keep all the vents open so I get wind noise but it isn't bad. I live in Texas and the temps are touching 100 degrees everyday.

So next I tried on the RF-1200 and it fit just right for my intermediate oval head.This helmet is very comfortable and has lots of great features. A few features that I especially like are that it accommodates glasses, has removable padding for cleaning, and has an easy to find tab to flip up the shield when you are at a stop light. The helmet doesn't feel heavy to me and has a nice wide field of vision.My only knock on the helmet is that the wind noise is higher than I expected. I have tried a few things, like closing the various vents and installing the chin curtain, but I still get quite a bit of wind noise. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.The helmet fits true to size. I measure a 23 inch head, which is right in between M and L.

The vents work well. It has a great wide view as well. Fit and finish are top notch. I will be buying another one soon as I had a low side slide at about 70 mph. The helmet saved my melon and my life I have no doubt about that. The face shield was scraped the left side was scraped and the back took the most pounding.

All I can say is that this helmet will break in. It took about 3 rides (5 hours) and it now fits perfectly. The cheekpads are a little snug but they are breaking in quickly and I am glad I stuck it out with the stock 35 mm size. If you try this helmet on when it is brand new and it fits perfectly, it is probably too big. I ride a Vrod and the wind is hard to handle at high speeds with my previous Bell Rogue helmet. This helmet cuts through the wind very effectively and I always feel safe and protected on the road. I wear foam ear plugs and the combination of this helmet and ear plugs is perfect noise level.

I can actually feel air rolling over my face, and noise level seems low.

I was wrong.55mph in this helmet feels and sounds like 35mph in my old one. Riding is just so much more effortless, and the noise level is barely louder than sitting inside an airliner at cruising altitude. It's so quiet, and the airflow is so good, that I can hear and feel a difference as I open or close each individual vent.Being a premium helmet, spare visors and pinlock inserts are a bit pricey, but I can fit a pair of sunglasses under this, so I may not bother getting a smoked-out visor.I should mention that I got this helmet in yellow, and it looks incredible. It's not hi-viz, but rather a true canary yellow. Not much gear comes in that color, so it's cool to have something that's highly visible and also pretty unique.\n",

      "First, let me say I'm biased. I have been a Shoei fan for 15 years. I've had AGV, Arai, KBC, Icon, and Shoei helmets over the years, and for me, Shoei just fit right.I needed a replacement for my beloved RF-1100 for track days and other spirited riding adventures. I have a Shoei Quest and an Icon Alliance, that are fine for the road, but I wanted a track day compliant helmet. So I got the matte black RF-1200 to match my Speed III.I love this helmet. It is so comfortable, flows air very well, and is very light weight. It is surprisingly quiet considering how light it is, but I still always wear earplugs, regardless of the helmet. The chin bar isn't overly big and intrusive, so it doesn't catch on my jacket or leathers when looking over my shoulder, as I've found on other brands. Also, the aerodynamics are great, which is a big deal on a naked bike. I don't have any issue with speed bobble, or lifting, and the visor stays tightly locked while \"checking your six,\" either upright or in the tuck.The pin lock is awesome as well. It isn't in my field of view, there is little to no halo-ing at night, and absolutely no fogging in rain, cold, or extremely hot and humid days here in the panhandle.I used to use the Quest of long rides or in the winter, and the Icon in the summer because of the great airflow, but now I grab the RF-1200 every time.

I haven't yet had an opportunity to use it in the rain, but I'm really impressed with the way that the face shield seals tightly against the helmet.I purchased this in person at the Philly showroom and the staff was, as usual, great at helping me with the sizing.

This thing is awesome. It's the first premium helmet I've ever had and I cannot see myself going back. Super quiet. Comfortable, and the thing feels like it could take a hit.

      "I had an RF-1100 that fit perfectly. I recently bought an Arai Corsair V to try a different brand but it dug into my forehead a bit and gave me a headache after about two hours. I guess my head is more oval shaped than I thought. So, I ordered an RF-1200 and it fits as well as the old RF-1100. The metallic black finish I received looks very impressive without being gaudy and is much nicer than plain gloss black. I wear my helmets tight because the liner eventually sacks out. Right now my cheeks are pinched in a bit but it is still comfortable.\n",

Finally able to not worry about getting too hot this summer.Noise level is a bit louder with this helmet compared to my old lid but its okay. I got music playing haha.I LOVE the top rear spoiler on the helmet and the slightly more narrow shape does help cut into the wind at higher speeds and combined that with its lightness.

      "I was originally using a Bell Qualifier, and too big to boot. It caught air when I head checked and had my neck straining to keep from twisting my neck off. With the RF-1200 no problems whatsoever. This thing just slices through the air as if I'm not wearing a helmet. The difference is huge. It doesn't seem \"much\" quieter but it is more noticeable on very long rides(2 hrs+). Overall I'm very glad I made the decision to buy a more premium helmet, as it has greatly improved my comfort on the bike.\n",

It's lighter and quieter than its predecessors, so it's nice to see Shoei never stops improving. As for durability and protection, I've been very happy with the previous ones so I'm sure this one won't disappoint either.The option of transition visor is also great; now if only they could get it back in stock!If there is one minus it's that I'm using the Uclear 200 boomless communicator. Because there is no boom, there is a little bulge on the actual speaker where the mic is. In the RF-1100, the spot for speakers had some room so that my speakers would fit nicely even with the bulge/mic. However with the 1200 they reverted to a basic hole for speakers so mine don't fit perfectly. I can make it work but it's not ideal.Otherwise I highly recommend this helmet!\n",

The field of view is amazing and the aerodynamics are top notch, I've head checked at just under 100 and it felt buttery smooth. The size of the helmet In general is pretty small, which is nice. The air flow is well too, and that's coming from a guy who lives in Florida. Conclusion: the price might be high, but it's definitely worth it!\n",

Pin lock lenses are great and offer a wide range of options. Only complaint is that the built in speaker space are a little too small for my Sena SMH10R speakers. Air flow is good but a couple of the vent closures are a little small when wearing gloves.

      "There are many fine helmet manufacturers in the market. The proper fit of the given lid is paramount. That's what I learned from Revilla's Bobby B. I'm lucky enough to live near the Revizlla Philadelphia Boutique; it's well worth the trip. Bobby consulted me after I told him the brands I was interested in. Arai, Shoie, and Scorpion. He spent time with me pointing out the 3 models in my price range and helped me find my correct fit. I can't say enough about the comfort level I got from his expertise and genuine interest in me getting the right helmet.Regarding the RF-1200. It is fanstastic from a styling standpoint, but where it really shined for me is the fit. Coming from more \"vanity\" type lids, this thing felt like it was part of me from the get go. It feels light and very comfortable. This has to go on your list as you find the fit for your specific noggin!Post purchase, Bobby asked me to come back by the helmet section so he could review the features and point out how to clean/maintain it.Bottom line is this is my first of many purchases from Revzilla. Well done!\n",

      "I carefully measured for my size. Checked the size charts several times. Then ordered the helmet with concern it would be too tight. The helmet arrived right on the scheduled time. I put it on and it was tight getting on. Once my head was inside the helmet fit was fine. I did not find any hot spots where pressure was a problem. The helmet moved with my head and stayed put. Vision is unobstructed. The helmet feels light on my head. I wore it around the house for several hours to just convince myself I have the correct size before I took it out for a ride. I have worn the helmet on a bunch of rides and find it comfortable even after several hours of use. The air flow is particularly good and helps greatly with overall comfort. The face shield closes down tightly yet is easy to raise and lower.Having the correct fit has made this helmet a winner for me. Also the air flow, I can actually feel the air moving across my face with the face shield closed. Overall this is the most comfortable helmet I have owned. I recommend this helmet to anyone looking for a very nice functional helmet.\n",

      "Really happy I went with this upgrade.My last helmet was a Shoei Qwest (size medium), and I really liked it, but I always ended up with a fairly prominent mark on my forehead after riding. I suspected that I had more of a narrow oval head, and was debating between a few different helmets.I was a bit hesitant to pay the higher cost for the RF-1200, but I'm incredibly glad I did. The shape fits my head much better, and after a few hours of riding, it has broken in nicely.I'm also amazed how much more aerodynamic it is. I took my Qwest out for the first long ride of the season, and was noticing how much my head was getting pushed around when I hit speeds around 65mph. I've taken the RF-1200 on two long rides so far, and it's like cutting through butter, even at high speeds.Really happy I reached out to Revzilla for a recommendation, and I'm really happy I invested in an upgrade. As long as it fits, you'll never regret investing in good gear.\n",

      "Prior to this, I had a Shark S900 and when I retired that, an HJC FG-17 which I compromised in a slow spill.I’ve always wanted a SHOEI but could never bring myself to drop so much money. All my helmets were about the same when it came to safety so I usually went with the option of saving a few hundred bucks.I walked into the Revzilla boutique thinking I had two choices. Buy another HJC for $180 or for once splurge on a premium helmet. I’m pretty sure the guy who works the helmet section must think I’m the most indecisive person ever as I kept on trying the two helmets for the better part of an hour and walking around the store looking at myself in the mirror and dreaming of a day I could own the Dainese Mike jacket.I finally had enough of my brain trying to analyze everything and justify the cost saving so I just said screw it! I want the SHOEI! In white…wait, no…in Anthracite…ummm, actually make that a white. I finally had to ask a fellow shopper for his opinion and he said the Anthracite looked good…so anthracite it was. Hi Viz be damned!Anyways, today I am absolutely blown away. I can’t believe how I have been robbing myself of a better experience every time I straddled my stead. I was ignorant to the fact that a helmet could actually be light, small and quiet. Riding to work this morning on the highway I was amazed at how much the turbulence and noise I used to experience was dramatically reduced. Riding truly feels different now, better, lighter, happier, less claustrophobic.The one thing I can say slight negative about the SHOEI – the chin guard is a little smaller than the HJC or Shark and because my breath hits it warmer, my glasses fog up a little easier. That’s the only negative but I am going for Lasik soon so I don’t care…and summer is here.Love my SHOEI! I will never be a budget helmet shopper again! ?And, Revzilla…you guys rock. Living in Philly now and being able to come to the boutique is j!zz inducing.\n",

      "I am a relatively new street rider and did a lot of research before buying my first helmet. I looked at multiple brands and models but always kept coming back to the shoei rf 1200 as it seems to be the best all around helmet in that price range. I know a few people around town that own shoeis and they solidified what I thought and told me they would never buy another helmet that was not a Shoei. I got my helmet (black) a few weeks ago and it has lived up to expectations and exceeded them with the pin lock, quietness and the easy to remove shield feature for cleaning.

Overall it is a good step up and feels great on. Sizing was dead-on my prior RFs.Pinlock was a great bonus feature but one that I wasn't seeking specifically. I find that I don't use it often - and removal at night is a pain if I don;t have a spot for it.One note - the chin vent really drives up the noise level, I find that unless I'm de-fogging I leave it closed. Might be my windscreen, but never noticed it in my 1000 or 1100s (of course their chin vents did;t work as well either so that might be it).Nice lid, comfortable all day long and vents well.

      "Great Helmet, A Little Tight\n",
      "Went to the Philadelphia store to try on a bunch of helmets and for the price, features, and comfort, I settled with the Shoei RF-1200. I've been circulating the sub-$150 helmet arena since riding and this is the first one I've purchased above that price point. It is considerably more quiet, comfortable, and the pin-lock visors eliminate the need to have to pop your visor up at every red light just to keep them from fogging.The only downside I had was that when I first tried it on, it fit great, but after a day of putting it on and taking it off over and over at various stops during my ride, the cheek pads started to scratch my cheeks, they didn't want to break in too much and became a nuisance. I opted to buy the 31mm Shoei Cheek Pad replacements which completely solved the issue - honestly, breaking-in the one's that came with it may have worked, but I did not wait long enough to find out.Overall, very pleased with this purchase and do not feel the need to upgrade to a higher priced helmet any time soon.\n",

I especially liked that this came with a chin wind guard as that is important to me. The noise is good and so is the air flow. It has ear cut outs on the inside for speakers if you want.

      "Shoei shows why it's top rated\n",
      "Obviously, the Shoei brand is one of the top names in the industry, and for good reason. As the owner also of the rf1100, I tried the Reevu and the Shark evoline Hakka, just to see how the competition stacked up.Needless to say, they both went back within days. Why? The Shark helmet is huge, even the size M I wear was gigantic. Yes, I looked like I was taking one giant leap for mankind when I put it on. I won't lie. It's more suited for the space shuttle than a sport bike. Then we have the Reevu, which is the only brand to have a built in rear view mirror. Now, in principle, this seems a fantastic idea, and indeed would have been, if only the mirror want so tiny. That, and the stock rear window is tinted, which means you'll have to buy the clear one if you can find it anywhere, because the tint really results in much worse visibility. Everywhere I checked was out of stock.The rf1200 is everything the 1100 is, plus more. And by more I mean less. Less shell size means you don't have a bobblehead, yet retain the same level of protection as the previous model. Rf1200 also comes with a pinlock anti fog shield for your visor. An optional upgrade for the rf1200 is the transitions shield that automatically changes from light to dark, depending on how bright the environment is. It's like $152 but cool as it gets, plus then there's no need for blacked out face shields, glasses, or internal drop down sun visors, which means this bad boy not only looks awesome, but it's both DOT and SNELL 2015 certified.Compared side by side with most brands, it's instantly apparent that the Shoei line is superior. The thing has a superior look and build quality whereas a lot of others just seem cheap and poorly constructed in comparison. Shoei helmets aren't so long front to back, either, so you escape that alien/lollipop appearance which we riders hate so much. Here, then, is the solution, instead of opting for a 3/4 face or open face helmet for that looking cool factor- which might not leave you with much face left if you crash and slide at 85 mph some day.\n",

      "I only have a Nolan N104 Modular to compare this to long term, which is definitely not apples to apples. But in certain ways, the comparison is apt: in fit, noise, and ventilation they have some similarities.I can say that this is much more cush, and the build quality feels appropriately higher for a helmet that cost about $200 more. The compact shell size is awesome - when I tried it next to a Lazer Monaco Carbon and the Nolan N86, they made me look like a bobblehead – and there is less interference and buffeting than the N104, but not dramatically so. Visibility is on par with the Nolan.I do miss the ratcheting chin strap – I would love Shoei to bring that to the States. But the N104 is noticeably quieter, while moving only slightly less air. This helmet is quite loud, which almost lost the sale - but the DOT and Snell rating, great looks, and numerous shield options (including the Transitions shield, which I'm on the wait list for), among other things, make it a good purchase. I'm guessing the other helmets I tried are even louder. I do ride with sound-isolating earbuds, which help (some) and still allow me to have my tunes – But since the RF-1200 is full face and snug, it's a bit tough getting it on without pulling the earbuds loose.I got the Orange \"High Def\" shield, and on my white RF-1200 it looks striking...with sunglasses on it's very comfortable in the LA sun. Overall, a very nice helmet with mostly positives. Gets a lot of compliments, and the quality is undeniable.\n",

      "I bought this helmet locally because I wanted to put it on before buying it. I was buying a helmet just for rain and cold weather as I do not normally wear one.Tried the 50 to 200 dollar range and noting would fit even up to 3XXX. What did fit...I couldn't see anything out of it without warping. No way was any of this stuff going to do me any good.So...painfully, I tried on this helmet. A large fit me as I had predicted it should. Fit was very tight and painful to put on but once on it did not need a strap to hold it on.So...after 6 months of riding in cold and rain I am disappointed in this product.1. Ventilation is almost non-existent. You must keep the visor up until you reach highway speeds even with all vents fully open. Sometimes you can never fully close the visor. Please note that I wear glasses and they are the first to fog and the last to un-fog. I must say that this helmet has great channels for glasses. None of the less expensive helmets even had them.2. The helmet strap is a nightmare. Have they not heard of the snap clips that are on many backpacks. It takes me forever while my glasses are fogging up to get it snapped so it won't fly around and bang against the helmet. I do not thread it through the two metal \"buckles\". They are not needed.I have heard that there is an \"AIR\" Version of this helmet. you might try that because this is a quality helmet. It just doesn't work right. At 450.00, I expected better.Would not buy again.\n",

I was very surprised that my cheaper helmet was ALOT quieter then the new shoei I just got, after all I am paying $500 some dollars. The comfort was bad because the stock cheek pads made me bite my cheeks pretty hard so I had to buy aftermarket cheek pads that were smaller for $40.

      "First, it's offered in four shell sizes, with pads and liners available in +/- thicknesses, so you can get a perfect fit with the smallest shell size you need. I also like the extra reinforcement of the face shield, making it nice and stiff, and helps it seal nicely . I rode with it for the first time today, and was very happy with the chin ventilation, visibility and comfort. I was impressed with how quiet it was, too. The finish and quality are top notch. The one complaint I have applies to other helmet mfg's as well as Shoei. Why can't the strap pads go all the way around the straps, like a sleeve; or at least have loops for the strap to go through, so that they stay under the strap? Oh well, the RF1200 is a great helmet, and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Transition's photochromic face shield, which will be the icing on the cake.\n",

That being said - everything about this helmet is good or better, there are no weaknesses. It is louder than expected but the stability is awesome. A big reason I got it was for safety features like advanced protection and the quick release chin pads - there's not slider for that. The transmission lens is still out of stock but I'm hopeful. I usually get a large, but I took a medium in this one although it was a bit snug at first, the pads have softened now after around 20hrs and it feels good. I didn't want to get a soft fit new only to have it swim on my head in a few months. Overall, I'm happy with the helmet though it did not live up to the hype IMO.

      "As a previous owner of the RF-1100, I found many differences for the better in the RF-1200. The RF-1100 is a GREAT helmet, my favorite before this one. The RF-1100s shell felt too round, big and the vents just felt cheap and tacky. I wore a size small in the 1100 and it was a little loose, but not too bad.Moving onto the RF-1200. HUGE upgrade! The vents are much better, the features are great and the carbon fiber face shield spring loaded track is awesome! The look of the helmet is amazing as well! The helmet also comes with a Pinlock lens. The downfall of the 1200 compared to the 1100 is because it's smaller in shape and more narrow, it hugs your cheeks more and hurts your ears when taking it off. The padding is thicker and that's the other reason for this. However you have the option of swapping out the padding for something better that works for your head shape.My solution! I took the pads out and laid them under a table or something heavy in order to break them in. I let it sit for about a few hours or so. As we all know, it will break in even more regardless. I bought the Matte Black with the smoked face shield and it looks awesome!\n",

To me, the outside of the helmet is noticeably smaller and more compact than, for example, the Shoei Qwest, which I wear on my sport touring bike. It looks the business. And although I feel it's \"True to Size,\" as I indicated here, the fit is snug around the sides of the head, cheeks and jaw, yet still plush and comfortable. The ventilation is better than I expected after reading some other reviews, the field of vision is refreshingly wider than many other lids, it's reasonably quiet and the finish is flawless.

      "I did a lot of research before buying this lid, and I am completely happy with this Shoei. I upgraded from an inexpensive modular that has no business being put side-by-side with the RF-1200, so I guess you would have to take my ravings with a grain of salt since I can't compare it within its class. I waited to write the review until after I had some significant seat time, so I developed my opinions over the past 4 or 5k miles.I was nervous about dropping half a g on one piece of equipment, but as soon as I pulled my matte black helmet out of the dust bag I was satisfied. It is not at all heavy, and the interior is very comfortable. All materials used feel well made, and the lines are excellently balanced to make it aggressive but not boy-racer. One of the biggest things I noticed was how well the aerodynamics were engineered on this helmet. Head-checks at speed or at greater speed are a non-issue; there is no sudden grab as the side profile of the helmet presents itself to the wind. Also, the ventilation works beautifully. Opening the chin vent is like turning a fan on that instantly moves air all through the face area. The downside to this feature is that the noise level increases significantly when the vents are open. However, it comes with the territory of moving large volumes of air. I have hit some pretty heavy rain and have experienced no issues with water leaking from any part of my helmet.My head shape is a little bit on the long side of round - not extremely so. I have found the RF-1200 very comfortable even over several hours of wearing it. The only time I have experienced discomfort was when I wore a thin thermal headliner, which added just enough material to add uncomfortable pressure to my forehead.All told I am a fan of this helmet, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone. I did purchase a gold mirrored CWR-1 that I use the pinlock with. Caveat: pinlock should be industry standard. It's awesome.\n",

      "My previous helmet was an HJC CLMax II. The RF1200 was a perfect fit for me. I struggled with the decision because of the price tag. I love this helmet, but it is loud.Pros: Comfortable, snug fit. Soft materials. Great visibility. Love the way the visor snaps shut. Very light. Don't feel as much wind resistance at high speeds.Cons: VERY LOUD. My first trip out I knew that earplugs were in my future. I haven't had a chance to try the pinlock yet, but it does fog up a lot without. $$$.\n",

He took his time with us and as I explained my favour with Shoei, he immediately pulled 3 helmets off the shelf. I explained the quietness of my old helmet and I wasn't willing to give that up. He couldn't believe I had a helmet over 15 yrs. old and still loved it. He had me try on 3 different types of helmets for size then style. I quickly eliminated the other 2 and wasn't impressed.

      "This is my first helmet purchase. I have no other helmet to compare it to. However I can say this...the fit on my head is excellent, with minimal gaps anyehere. The ventillation is also excellent and I do not sweat at all when wearing it here is central Florida. Now the wind shield is a little hard to open because the lift tab is off-center causing the shield to 'twist' as it is opened. It's also annoying that is not quieter. Now, I know I have no other helmet to compare it to but after riding my Harley Fat Boy for about 20 minutes, my ears are ringing. Yes, I have Screaming Eagle pipes but they are baffled and not the loudest available. Actually, riding without the helmet is better on my ears. Maybe it's a resonance issue. As far as aerodynamics go, it's great and does not try to lift or pull at highway speeds. It does tend to make air-rushing noises around the wind shield if I turn my head to check left/right at speed. I think this can be expected.The helmet is very high quality and functionally works as its supposed to. I would definately buy another Shoei!\n",

      "Upgraded from Bell Vortex and the RF1200 flows a TON more air to the shield, forehead, everywhere. Feels way more stable at speed, and the shell is a bit smaller too. I got the matte black. Also love the snug cheeks, feels solid without being tight. Perfect fit for my head. Love the aggressive but classic shape. Included pinlock insert is awesome.7 nitpicks - 1) top vents faintly whistle at speed. 2) speaker cutouts way too shallow, my Sena speakers rubbing my ears, should be 2mm deeper. 3) Nice cheek pads, but almost no room to tuck speaker/mic wires - if you do, you struggle to snap pads into place. 4) The chinstrap button snap is way up there and hard to engage until you get used to it. 5) face shield \"unlocks\" with barely any upward force to the left side of shield. 6) Rear vent switch impossible to tell which way I slide to open or close. 7) emergency cheekpad red tabs are HIDDEN by the chin curtain. EMTs might wonder, \"pull what red tab???\"Love the helmet. But for the hefty price, I shouldn't have any of the above issues. Looking forward to continued improvement. Otherwise it's an excellent helmet.\n",

      "What can I say, that hasn't been said? I love this helmet. I bought this helmet as a replacement to my Shoei RF-1100 after a crash. The 1100 did its job and is unfortunately discontinued, so I purchased the 1200. The 1200 fits better, the cushioning inside is a bit thicker but compresses really well for that perfect no-move fit you want in a helmet. I like the addition of the emergency removable cheek pad liners with instructions on the helmet for emergency personnel to limit further injury when in a severe crash situation. The emergency removal instruction stickers are black with white print and are approximately 1&3/4\" x 3/8\" and are located at the bottom on each side where the pull tabs on the cheek pads are located. The visor has been updated from the 1100 as well, with a more solid and simplified mechanism that also seems to be stronger than the 1100. The vizor also appears as if it will keep out more water than its predecessor did with a better sealing gasket and a stronger spring system to keep the visor tight against the gasket. I haven't had the pleasure of riding in the rain for the past 2 weeks but as a daily commuter who has seen plenty I feel confident that the 1200 will stay drier than the 1100. The visor offers an exceptionally wide view. I cannot see the helmet in my peripheral vision and only see an extremely small portion of the side of the helmet when looking directly at it. Additionally, the 1200 moves more air through the helmet than its predecessor, something I appreciate a lot as a person who wears corrective lenses. I have not had any problems with the visor fogging here in humid and unusually cold Atlanta, and that is without using the pin-lock anti-fog system. Only at a complete stop do my eyeglasses fog and only if I do not raise the visor. The Shoei RF-1200 even manages to be more silent than its predecessor. Simply put, this helmet out performs the RF-1100 in every way. As mentioned everywhere, this helmet fits someone with a more oval shaped head, so pay attention to your skull shape when considering helmets.\n"

      "So I have had this helmet for about 6 months. I ride every day.At first it was kind of loud on my Ninja 650. Since I got a naked bike Z1000 it got quieter since there is no windshield that makes it turbulent. Doesn't budge until hitting 140+ MPH and even then barely moves. The chin curtain is annoying I took it out. The helmet doesn't make your head sweat when its hot but it doesn't keep it as cool. You don't really feel the wind too much with all the vents open but if its hot you know they are open or closed. The cheek pads and construction are very good. the pin lock never fogs. And it has smaller silhouette than most helmets so youre only sorta bobbleheaded. But Next time I will look at a GT Air or Arai Defiant. Not a bad helmet it does everything well but for a 400+ helmet that has had \"years of development and revolution\" I expect more.\n",

      "ABOUT HELMET:<br>This is a great helmet and the quality is top notch. I've bough $400-$600 helmets before and Shoei blew my mind at the quality. Shoei is going to be my go to helmet brand from now on.<br><br>I got the matte black (size large) and white (size medium). The matte black is such a great color, but it got fingerprints really easily and it was hard to wash off. The white is a clean and fresh color, more visible, and looks awesome (IMHO). I'm sure lots of other colors in the line look amazing too, Shoei knows what's up.<br><br>The only thing I do not like is the strap pads, the pieces of fabric that are supposed to protect your jaw from the strap. They feel cheap and do not cover the strap well. My last helmet had much higher quality and it felt nicer. I may try sewing them into position, which may or may not be worth the effort. The helmet still feels comfortable.<br><br>ABOUT SIZING:<br>I bought this helmet in large after contacting Revzilla and watching/reading tons on media on the internet. It seemed a size large would be best for me.<br><br>I got it and it fit snug. By most accounts, it fit me well enough to use. Nonetheless, I had a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't snug enough. If my helmet needs to protect my head (hopefully not), I want it to do so in the best possible way. Getting the size right is critical.<br><br>I went to my local shop and tried on the same helmet. Sure enough, a medium was a better fit for me. I ordered the M and returned the L.<br><br>I encourage everyone to watch LOTS of videos about sizing (I put a good one in the video section of this review) and try on helmets in person before buying, even if you think your head clearly fits into a size chart (I fit in the lower end of large, but got a medium). You are not a size chart. Actually go try on helmets. It could save your life.\n",

Stable helmet at speed, feels very secure and well made.\n",

      "I just recently purchased the red, white, and blue graphic Shoei RF-1200 helmet and first of all I am very impressed about this lid.The fit as of now is a little tight, but the cheek pads will wear in eventually. The wind noise is still apparent, but it is a lot less harsh than what the rf1100 was. The visor does have a larger opening and I'd say it seals better than the rf100 as well. I just rode through a decent rain and not a drop came into the helmet at 60mph+. The lightness and compactness of the new shell shape is immediately noticeable, you can actually turn your head quickly in any direction at an speed. Buffeting as been reduced aside from being right behind a semi-truck. Ventilation is a little more than the rf1100, but is placed in more strategic areas that maximize cooling.The graphics and clear coat quality is excellent, hopefully those will last a long time.I'll comment as the time goes by that I use this helmet and review as things go....scout's promise!\n",

      "Great helmet, but a word of warning for bluetooth users\n",
      "I have a long oval shaped head, and after almost 10 years of buying over-sized, less expensive helmets I decided it was time to get a properly fitting one based on my head size and shape.I was wearing XL helmets but my actual headsize put me right between M and L, so I went with L. When I first got it, it was really tight, especially around my face. I sat in my living room with it on for over an hour pondering to keep it or return it for a larger size. I'm glad I kept it and now after 5 or so hours of riding, it feels great and snug.The helmet itself is dead quiet or at least seems that way compared to my HJCs and Oneal. I ride an adventure bike and I was able to stop using earplugs with all of the vents closed. The pinlock shield does its job and the whole setup feels very sturdy.My only issue was in the fitting of a sena bluetooth system. The helmet comes with speaker pockets, which is great but where they formed the part where the speaker wire comes out of the speaker, it wasn't deep enough so the speaker wouldn't fit flush. With great care and caution, I was able to use a drill and make that opening just a hair wider and after that, the speakers fit perfectly and I was able to use the speaker covers that came with the helmet after removing the round piece of foam that normally would fill the empty void. Also, because of the shape of the side pads that come out below the shell, I couldn't use the clamp for the sena, I had to use the peal and stick permanent mount. It works fine, but I was hoping not to blemish the helmet so soon after purchase.Overall I'm glad I finally broke down and got a nice helmet. I would definitely recommend this helmet to anyone with the mid to long oval head shape.\n",

      "Best helmet in this price range\n",
      "If you want to protect your head and do it right dont look to cut corners on your helmet. Bargain helmets for $100 or so are made with the minimum standards to get through Snell and DOT. This company has never been in the business of making bargain helmets as they are concerned with product design functionality, user friendly features and maximum protection to your head, which is what you use a helmet for in the first place. Bike parts are replaceable and upgradeable, your head isnt so expect that this quality will be reflected in the price, which I feel is quite reasonable for what the RF-1200 delivers.PROS:-Maximum air flow from numerous well placed vents around the helmet decrease heat in summer and block cold air in cold weather. These vents are easy to use while riding and are sturdy so there is no concern of breaking them, unlike an old helmet I used which the vents constantly broke because they were poorly made.- Sealed and insulated helmet creates quiet riding atmosphere. I had no idea what I was missing til I wore this helmet. With the vents closed and my ear protection in the wind noise is noticeable but not bothersome by any means. You can never fully eliminate wind noise especially if you plan to ride hard, but this helmet does about as best you could.- Lightweight design substantially decreases rider fatigue and allows for easier rear checks when changing lanes, turning etc. My neck often hurt after long days of riding with my the other helmet which was about 6 lbs or more, the RF-1200 is half of that and it makes a difference.-Snug fit and increased padding placement makes for greater protective environment and more comfortable wear. I was right on the border of a medium and a small. I contacted Revzilla customer service who suggested to go with a medium and that I could buy small sized padding if I needed to reduce space. Glad I did because the medium fits me great but good to know that is an option.- Pin lock feature is awesome for anti-fog use especially when I ride in cold weather below 60*CONS:- Minimal designs for the helmet appearance limit customization. This is unfortunately typical for this company because they focus more on the quality of the product they seem to consider appearance as an afterthought. I love to see awesome art on other helmets and wish this company would offer this feature on future helmets. Looking cool and being safe dont have to be mutually exclusive.- That \"new helmet\" smell still lingers months after I bought it and put thousands of riding miles in it. Its probably unavoidable but the nasty toxin smell I could do without.\n",

      "I've been wearing an old RF-1000 for several years, and finally splurged on a new Shoei. I thought the RF-1200 would be a step up. But it's so much louder than the RF-1000, the airflow isn't improved at all, and it's missing the shield lever to prop the visor open ever so slightly. It also doesn't fit the same head shape. The RF-1000 was a better fit for a moderate oval, and the RF-1200 is more for a round head shape. It squeezes my forehead and back of my head like a vice. The next size up was too wobbly on my head, so this is definitely an issue with just my head shape and not the helmet itself. Considering the loud noise from the wind, the absence of a built-in sun visor, and missing Bluetooth, this helmet's way overpriced for what it is. I'm looking to replace it with something half the price.\n",

      "I've worn the Icon Alliance and Airmada for very long time before getting the RF-1200 so this is my comparison.The visor on the Icons feel more sturdier and rugged. I flip the visor down hard and fast and flip it up the same way. Once the RF-1200 unlatched it's right hinge where I never had a problem with and Icon. The visor on Icon raises and lowers evenly where the Shoei's feel it must be controls from the center of the visor to do the same.The Pin Lock is a joke. First time out on an 80 degree evening and there was temporary breath fogs. Icon can prevent fogging without that extra visor shield.The strap padding feeling better, thicker and more durable with the Icon as well. The Shoei's \"button\" is too far deep where it's quite difficult with gloved hands.I am curious to compare the Icon Airframe to the RF-1200 since it's about $150 less and weighs similarly and supposed to vent much better. It was a close call from those two, but tucked tail like a corporate wh0re and went the Shoei route.\n",

      "Good overall helmet with some downsides\n",
      "Bought this helmet after comparing to the HJC IS-17, the Shoei Qwest and the Arai RX-Q and Signet-Q. Fit and finish are as described - a little tight at first but fits your head better with each ride. The removable liner is money and the quality and feel of the materials that touch your face is excellent. And the helmet is very quiet in clean air like on the Nighthawk with no fairing and has very little push when I turn my head.The downsides: the wind noise behind the fairing of an 1150 RT is LOUD. Even closing all the vents and trying to tuck behind the fairing, I cannot find a sweet spot to reduce the whistling. Maybe the bike just pushes too much wind. Lastly, I have already had some fogging issues on 60 degree mornings. I hope installing the Pinlock will make that go away.\n",

The anti fog of the CW visor is great with no change to clarity and it doesn't get in the way when looking out through the sides of the visor. I would definitely recommend this helmet to anyone looking for an aggressive helmet with comfort and function in every aspect.\n",

      "I purchased the rf-1200 after buying a z1000. I was going to get the Arai Defiant but ended up choosing the rf1200 after speaking to a gear geek. I am glad I listened. Even on a naked bike without any windscreen this helmet is relitivly quiet. I get minimal buffeting and minimal pull while turning my head at speed. I was getting a slight whistle from the edge of the visor near the hinge while turning my head. I adjusted the hinge at the side of the visor which forces the spring to pull the visor into the gasket and the problem is now gone. This is probably the best all around helmet on the market. Air flow is great. On long rides I forget I'm wearing a helmet. It's light and pretty quiet. Worlds quieter than my Bell RS-1.\n",

Got great help and advice at the Revzilla store so I could make a decision based on safety, air flow, shape and weight. So far so good, still a bit snug in the cheek area but getting better. I can always adjust it in the future if necessary. Thanks Bob at Revzilla, you were very helpful in this key element of my belief in ATGATT. If I sound a bit like an ad for Revzilla so be it, they have really helped me big time in my last three purchases.\n"

      "Review wise, I must say the the little bit I rode in the RF1200 was much better than my Qwest helmet. The Qwest had more of a roaring wind noise. The RF1200 had more of a mid-toned wind noise which was more bearable. The lens on the RF1200 is thicker and along with a few other bits makes the helmet appear to have a higher standard of quality compared to the Qwest.I purchased the \"Shiny Red' in hopes that it would match my Ducati Monster 1200. It was a close match, but not as close as I hoped it would be. Luckily, RevZilla is freaking amazing and they let me do an exchange for a solid gloss black. Thanks RevZilla!\n",

For reference, I put my iphone at half volume and while going 80 on the fwy, I can hear my music just fine over the exhaust and the wind. In contrast, I would have to put the volume on full blast with an rf-1100 in order to hear the music at all.Also substantially lighter, and the vents work better IMHO. And the view is so good honestly it looks like I'm not wearing a helmet at all. 100% visibility.Only thing I didn't like is I have pretty high (large?) cheek bones and I get chipmunk cheek.

Fits well on chubby cheeks, chafes a little if you get head sweat on it when putting it on, a quick towel off before donning fixes that.

Helmet feels much lighter than the old 1100, but that's probably mostly from the smaller shell size.Shied operation is much smoother than on the 1100, and the shield itself is beefier and more solid. Included pinlock rocks!Airflow is probably better than the 1100, but I can't tell the difference & the back vent is harder to open while riding, but I'll probably get used to it.Only negative is that the speaker cups are smaller than they were on my old RF1100, and caused my SMH10R speakers to need some trimming/filing to fit.I hope it's going to be grandfathered in once the SNELL 2015 certification is published; and even if it isn't, it's a great helmet and I don't regret the purchase.\n",

So far I put the chin curtain on...and it was a little tricky.I ride a upright bike and a sport bike...my goal was to reduce noise while riding the up right since the windshield wind breaks right at the top of the helmet and create noise. This helmet seems better than my Bell...I think that just because of the new 3D liners inside all helmets are going to do this. It's funny they calling this a good feature...but from what I can see it saves the company money. My old HJC CL-12 helmet from 2002 is quieter than both these helmets. Why...no 3D liner...full liner.On the plus side...I truly like the feature for people that wear glasses, it has the cut outs and my glasses fit in perfect. However, at high speeds...135+ glasses moved around a lot.Later this year suppose to have the transitional lens...\n",

Helmet is light, and for a size \"Large\" is a compact helmet- especially compared to some manufacturers with limited shell sizes, that when you get to a Large you are into their largest shell size. Cheek pads are a bit tight for my face, but are breaking in. May go to cheek pads that will give a bit more room if they don't break in much further. Helmet is very stable at highway speeds, including turning your head. Airflow is good.I was surprised that the helmet is as noisy as it is. I'm okay with it, but thought it would be quieter. Had an AGV Horizon that was much quieter than this. Overall, a very good helmet- would recommend.\n",

      "I think Helmet reviews are very subjective. Obviously everyone's taste and head is different and what might fit one person perfectly is totally uncomfortable for another. I wish everyone put their head measurements in their reviews so we know why the size they chose did or did not fit well.So that being said I think it's also important to say that I have worn 4 helmets while riding; an older AGV, a Scorpion, lately a Bell Vortex, and finally my RF-1200. My head circumference is 22-5/8\" which places me right in the Medium on the size chart. I think I have an intermidiate oval head shape. I purchased a Medium RF-1200. And lastly I've only had the Shoei for a few weeks so I couldn't truly comment on durability but the fit and finish on this is beautiful so I'm sure it will hold up.Now to my thoughts on the Helmet. The Medium fits me perfectly. It feels very compact and looks compact on your head(no bobble head). I prefer a snug fitting helmet and this one is snug in all the right places while being very comfortable where pressure points would be such as around the ears and forehead. I like the material used in the lining much better than the dry fit type lining others use. The helmet is rock solid on my head. At speeds over 65mph there is basically zero buffeting and no lift what so ever. There was no movement during head checks at speed and the viewing port gives great field of vision. It's not the most quite helmet but much quiter then the Bell Vortex (which didn't fit me well which may be a part of the reason). The chin strap was in a good position forward enough that it didn't cut in on my throat. The shield mechanism works great to swap shields out and it seals beautifully. However it is fairly stiff to operate up and down (you can customize how tight you want it but I didn't notice much difference). The only complaint I have is the ventilation, this was the only reason I didn't give the helmet a 5 out of 5 stars the vents are pretty small and you don't get much airflow because of this (that's one thing the Vortex did well). The only other thing I wish they offered was a few classic/simple graphic designs but that's just me being picky.I know this is a long review but I found the reviews very helpful and wanted to be thorough. Again I recommend looking at my measurements and the size chart so you can compare where you might fit. Everyone fits different but for me this one was golden. Hope this helps, Godspeed.\n",

I've actually had it come undone while riding which is just dangerous!!! The third and final straw for me was the chin vent not opening and closing properly! With the amount of money I spent on this helmet, I expect it to work well and last! The helmet does have a couple of positives. Great airflow and it just fits! I've had several other Shoei helmets in the past and they were always the helmet manufacturer of choice, but it seems that right now their quality control is lacking which is just disappointing.

This helmet broke in pretty well, I could probably do a large, then again, If I had the large I might be pining for the xl. Either way, keep on mind a fair amount of \"softening up\" , not see if it's shoei or this helmet in particular, but paint seems a bit easy to scratch. I barely rubbed and lightly banged it into a few things ,my mx helmets would show nothing, the shoei has some paint scratches. All in all a fantastic, safe and comfortable helmet. Highly recommended. Of you are looking at the similar arai, do yourself a favor and try on the rf 1200..\n",

      "I can't say that I'm very experienced with helmets (came from an AFX FX-39 helmet) but I can say that I have tried a lot on. With that said, I will comment on fit, and not as much on noise and ventilation. I would sit in my local shop for hours trying on icon's, HJC, Scorpion and Shoei for about 20-30 minutes at a time. The RF-1200 seemed to be the most compact, with a streamlined aggressive look. It seemed to encompass my head better than the HJC and Icon's. With the Shoei, I didn't experience any pressure points in the temple or frontal portion of my head as I seemed to experience with Icon. In the end, I was between Scorpion and Shoei; I eventually decided on shelling some extra coin for the Shoei, and haven't looked back. It feels stable at speed (obviously much more compared to my AFX FX-39) and head checks are still comfortable at speeds 90+mph. Never had any issues fogging, but ventilation is considerably less than my AFX FX-39; but in turn the Shoei is much quieter. If I could change one thing, the liner does seem to catch on my facial scruff more than other helmets (being picky here).Invest in something that you'll be happy with for years to come. I'd recommend to anyone. After all, it's a Shoei..\n",

I have Neck and Back problems so I'm already in pain all the time. I needed a lighter helmet so I tried out many of different ones. I liked this one the best for the price. The air flows right around it too. I go fast all the time and half helmets have no aerodynamics. Modular helmets are big and bulky and catch a lot of air also. Also when it rains the RF-1200 keeps you completely dry. No water comes up around your neck. A nice tight fit.\n",

      "I have never owned a helmet that has not been a Schuberth, but I just added a BMW s1000RR to the garage and the track was calling me. I notices I didn't have an adequate helmet. Tried the Shuberth SR1 and really didn't feel the bang for buck. I have a pretty oval head which has always been a problem with helmets. but I must say that the RF-1200 fit perfect, it's extremely light. I was hesitant in the beginning, since I thought I had to shell out \"tons\" for a track day helmet, but called one of the specialist at Revzilla and made me feel confortable.I must say I have yet to use it much, but the field of view is superb, the ventilation really is spot on and the vents close well (it's winter done here), it si silent and light, t but the chin curtain is kinda flimsy. The standard PINLOCK is great. I have not bought a helmet with out a pinlock visor for over many years, actually I can't really imagine riding with out one, to the fact that it's standard on the RF-1200 made my pick a lot easier.I've used it both on the track and as a commute helmet and as I said; so far... real good.Apart from the flimsy chin vent the other downside is that it has a two loop chins strap system, I much prefer the quick latches I get when I buy helmets in Europe, I have yet to buy a helmet in the US that doesn't use two loops, maybe it's some sort of law or something in that country.\n",

      "In the past (20 years ago) I've tried Shoei helmets and they were always too round shaped for me. My last full face helmet was a 2002 Arai Signet GT in XL. It was a perfect fit. Since then I switched to 1/2 and 3/4 Helmets; a Bell 500 3/4 in XL being my favorite for the last couple of years. This year I was on a quest to find a comfortable full face helmet. After trying three other helmets in a two sizes each, I landed on the RF-1200 in size L with the 31mm cheek pads.The RF-1200 is true to size, believe the chart! It is super comfortable while fitting snug. Ventilation is awesome. The Pinlock visor really works. There is room for helmet speakers. The size L shell is super compact and looks more like a size M. The metallic black paint job is first class. My only minor gripe is the ridge along the bottom of the shield is a bit annoying visually when cracked open a notch or two.\n",

The chin strap placement is great, and the air flow is really good. My only gripe with this helmet is the visor lock, on my older helmet it was locked in place by a small lever. The 1200, has a step lip at the bottom, and you just apply more pressure than normal to get it over the lip to lock it in place. This requires, usually, two hands to do ( one on the visor and one at the tab) and when it locks its quite loud. 99% of the time i dont have it completely locked down because of this hassle.

      "My First Helmet and Why I Chose It Over Others\n",
      "Bought my first street bike (CBR600RR) a week ago and bought the Shoei RF-1200 in Matte Black along with the Dark Smoke CWR-1 Pinlock Shield for my first helmet. Your helmet isn't something you want to skimp on so I was looking for a mid-to-top of the line helmet with DOT and Snell2010 approved protection and a cool/comfy design. I'm 5'11\", 195 LBS, and I guess you could say I have a larger head than most, used some XL helmets in the past for motocross. But the Large RF-1200 fit me just perfect. Snug enough to stay put and not shift around at higher speeds but not too tight by any means. Basically the perfect comfy fit I was looking for.The other helmets I was contemplating was the cheaper Bell RS-1 and the more expensive Bell Star(considered the Star Carbon model too). I really liked the look and protection of those Bell helmets. Arai helmets have the quality/protection but didn't have the look I wanted. There's cheaper Icon helmets that look awesome but wasn't convinced on the protection side.The Bell Star was a little too expensive for me as my first helmet. It is also a straight up track racing helmet with aerodynamics made for higher speed and I read that it's pretty loud too. I'll probably reconsider the Bell Star Carbon though in a few years.I honestly planned on buying the Bell RS-1 for the longest time. The inside and outside designs looks great. The antibacterial/microbial pads and liners looked soft. The RS-1 apparently have a bigger shell. And with already having a large head i didn't want to look like a bobble head, so I paid a little more for the RF-1200, which I honestly think has a better interior with the smooth leather at the bottom.I'm in Texas and its been getting hotter, and my RF-1200 has no issue with being too hot. Also the older RF-1100 reported having whistling noises. I haven't had any problems like that with the 1200.Compared to the RS-1 the Shoei has a better history in the sportbike category, the Shoei is cost a little more and the shields cost a little more too than the Bell Shields, but it's definitely a great helmet.Can't go wrong with either one.I would advise going to a local shop to at least try on the different helmets to see how they fit. Don't just assume.\n",

Ultra cool looking in the flat black, pin-lock anti-fog system works flawlessly, light, air flow is good, and the helmet is quiet. Very comfortable and even in Texas 90+ degree heat my head doesn't get sweaty even though my upper body is soaked underneath my leather jacket. Minimal buffeting at very high speeds.

      "After reading enough reviews, I decided to choose this helmet over the GT-Air. It just seemed to fit better at the B&M (I'm exactly at 59cm). I fit the RF-1200 Large perfectly, but the GT-Air was a little too snug on my ears, which would have put me in a XL. Either helmet would have been a huge upgrade over my \"questionable\" HJC CL-14 hand-me-down. Glad my decision was a good one.Ordered from Revzilla and wore it around the house for a week before taking it out on the road. No hot spots that I could feel. Fits like a glove now. Interior definitely feels plush.Airflow is great, once I figured out all of the openings. Chin vent definitely moves air over your face. If you wear contacts, just be aware of the possible dryness.I didn't really notice any neck strain or pulling during head checks. The weight of the helmet itself seems to be pretty\"Quiet\" is a subjective term. Would definitely say that this mutes wind noise over my CL-14, but I still wouldn't ride without earplugs. The included chin curtain definitely helps with keeping out turbulent wind noise.Haven't had to use the pinlock insert yet. Bought the dark smoke shield along with this. Was not disappointed. It definitely cuts down on the Texas heat and glare in the afternoons. Only drawback is that the Transitions shield still isn't available, but I'm happy with my dark smoke shield.I would definitely recommend this helmet to others (if it fits their head shape).\n",

Fit is similar, quality is excellent, and compared to the RF-1100, notable improvements include:-- MUCH lighter weight-- Seems quieter so far-- Has a very satisfying German-car-door 'thunk' when closing the visorOne major con for me, however:-- Shoei could probably have pulled random shapes out of a hat and not come up with a worse surface for a chin-mounted GoPro setup. The front of the RF-1200 chin bar is a sort of series of gently undulating curves that is utterly prohibitive for a good adhesive mating surface. If you are dead set on having a chin mount, you might want to look at another helmet.\n",

I used the video and charts to size my head and when I first got it I thought that it may be too tight and my ears were getting beat up with the off and on, but after a putting it on a couple dozen times it feels perfect. I was actually quite surprised about then venting. It's not too hot yet, but I only had the chin vent open and it has felt great on my rides with good airflow. The pin lock was an added benefit to this helmet and easy to install. The only other worry that I had would have been the color. I went with the matte black and even the label on the helmet says to be careful of staining the helmet. But so far, just a little water and a soft towel has taken any fingerprints or what have you off for me. For the style, protection and other features like the Pinlock and the venting I would say this was a pretty great deal in my book.\n",

      "Amazing Helmet!\n",
      "When I took this helmet out of the box I started second guessing my decision to drop $400+ on a helmet. I wasn't blown away and the fit was really really tight(enough that I considered returning it). After riding home though, I was blown away. Very quiet, almost unrealistic quiet, like I was playing a video game on mute. Then the clarity and field of view. I kept catching myself reaching up to put the visor down but it was already closed. After a few days of commuting and then going on a 500 mile trip it was broken in very well. I bit tight to pull off but it fits just as it should, very comfortable. When it's time to get another helmet it will be another Shoei for sure. I wasn't thrilled with the graphics selection so I went with the flat black. It is a chore to keep it clean, Anthony mentions that in the video. I have been using Motul helmet cleaner on it with no discoloration or shiny spots so that is a plus. I hope in the future they release some more graphics options.\n",

This is the first pinlock visor I have ever used and I can honestly say I'll never have another helmet without it. I have intentionally tried to fog it and can't.

      "Excellent move from RF-1100\n",
      "I purchased this helmet because I was very pleased with my RF-1100 and the protection it provided me in a crash late last year. I tried other helmets including several Arai models and just could not find one that fit as well as the RF-1200. I have an IO head shape. The review of this helmet is spot on in my opinion. It's smaller and lighter which is also a plus. I like the pinlock system. It really works! Fog on the inside of the face shield is non-existent. I wondered why it was not supposed to be used at night so I gave it a try and definitely saw why. Because of the double layer, you can see double lights and couple that with some sprinkles I had that evening, I would choose to remove the pinlock insert for any future night rides. Reviewers on another site stated you \"get used to it\" but in my opinion, it's not worth the risk.My only complaint is with how the breath guard attaches. It doesn't sit completely flush and doesn't feel like it \"snaps\" into place as it does on the RF-1100. This was confirmed with several models in a local store as well as a Revzilla associate. There is not a functional problem but it tends to pop out if you carry your helmet though the face opening or if you store it by hanging it off your handlebars. If you look close enough, you can even see this in the review video.\n",

      "I bought this helmet to replace an hjc cl-16. Huge difference! I would equate the noise level to wearing an hjc with ear plugs. The fitment is a bit different though. I had to buy the 31 mm cheek pads to replace the supplied 35 mm ones that come with the small helmet. The original pads pressed on my face and the bottom of my ears really hard causing significant pain after 30 minutes, but the smaller pads fixed that problem. The helmet fits perfectly now and its smaller frame makes head checks so much easier. I would definitely recommend this helmet to someone who's looking for the next level of protection.\n",

I like the fact that now on a hot day, cold day, and even in the rain the helmet NEVER fogs up, thanks to the pinlock system. The helmet also fells a little lighter.

Firstly what drew me to the helmet was the aggressive style/shape that it has, and with the matte black color being so versatile, I can wear just about any color gear. The next big feature for me is the venting and airflow. The helmet is capable of holding heat and keeping you warm but also exhausting that heat when the vents are open. The removable chin curtain is great for windy rides and/or cold days, and the entire inner liner can be removed as needed for washing. Lastly the pin-lock lens cannot be overlooked as it provides great protection against fogging and it COMES IN THE BOX. I could not be happier with my purchase.\n",

I always take a small in Shoei and 1200 fits snug compared to the Qwest but in a good way. Other than being a little more difficult to take off this helmet seems to fit me better. Very quiet with the shield down, I have tried the venting on the cold and can feel lot's of air hit my face and head. Love the looks, very cool but no over stated.Still have a snap closure versus a ratchet and I am more than comfortable with that. Hopefully I will never have to have someone use the emergency cheek pad removal but nice to know the pads have a RED tab so to show anyone who might find me can easily pull the check pads out to remove my helmet in an emergency.Comes with a pin local shield as part of the price which is reasonable for such a well made helmet. Not the lightest one on the market but lighter to me. Was a PITA to install my Cardo G4 mount but I seemed to be able to get it secured. I understand Cardo may have a special intercom set up for this helmet like the Shuberth in the near future. Have not seen it on their web site yet.Great field of vision, easy on and off shield for cleaning, sun but comfy fit, great looks, great venting all at an impressive price to protect your biggest investment your head.\n",

      "I went to the store front while I was in the Philly area to try on a Bell Star Carbon and ended up liking the Shoei RF-1200 and the Arai Vector 2.I originally had no intention of buying another Shoei because the RF-1100 was such a disappointment compared to the RF-1000 I had. The shell was bigger (M2010 compliance), whistled when I turned my head with the upper vents open, hurt my head after wearing it for more than 10 mins.This is where the staff at revzilla was the most helpful in steering me to consider the RF-1200 with its recent redesign and new features.New features that I liked:. Smallest Snell M2010-compliant shell profile available on the market; next to the Bell Star Carbon and the Arai Vector 2, it is noticeably smaller. The smaller shell size also gives it a 0.3 to 0.4 lb weight savings over the Bell Star Carbon and Arai Vector 2. If you wear all 3 in comparison, the Shoei feels less cumbersome.. Emergency cheek pads release. Nothing to add. Didn't test them.. CWR-1 pin lock visor with soon-to-be available Transitions lens for $150. The lens will use the same Transitions technology that Bell contracted not the failed tech used by scorpion. Definitely a nice scalable option for the helmet which is not available on the Arai where you'd have to stop to put on sunglasses or use tearoffs.. The visor no longer has a lever. The visor locks using a snap fit and the cracked position is where the visor naturally sits just above the locked position but below the first ratchet stop. The visor can be hard to unlock sometimes (wasn't even wearing a glove) but I think it'll get easier and the snap fit wears in a little. It would also be interferon to see how well the snap fit design wears with age and repeated use.The comfort was fine, but not the best. The helmet felt a little hard on the top corners of my head (could be a head shape conflict - slightly more round/square than intermediate oval). I wore it for the 10 to 15 mins while I shopped in the store looking at shorts, gloves, jackets and it probably will be fine even if it wasn't the most comfy. The Arai Vector 2 was the best in terms of comfort. I could wear that helmet all day and forget that I was wearing it. The padding at the top was spot on to my head shape.The only two aspects I did not get to vet were the ventilation and the wind noise. They only let you run so fast inside the store and the helmets can't leave the store. There are more intake vents compared to the RF-1100. A brow vent and two top-of-the-helmet vents with 3 settings instead of 2. The brow vent is infinitely variable for fine adjustment. The mouth vent has 3 fixed positions.I'd be super stoked if I could get it in a dry carbon look with a graphic like the Bell Star Hess, but you don't even look at the outside unless it's off your head so it's more of a vanity requirement if you like being vain.\n",

Other helmets created pressure points on my forehead and occiput and left empty space on the sides (despite needing XL in other brands and L in Shoei). I do appreciate the light weight of this helmet and solid build construction. This helmet probably has less features than the less expensive scorpion helmet (1100) I was looking at, and cost 2x as much. But you can't put a price on a perfect fit, especially when it comes to protecting you rmelon. I love the included PinLock lens (decided to go with 1200 over the awesome deal on the 1100 for this reason, as well as the 2 ounce weight loss).

I love it so far and have only ridden about 200 miles with it!!!I ride a 2014 Yamaha V-Star 950 Tourer\n",

It has kept me warm on these winter nights, and so far the vents have been more than adequate to cool my head on 60+ days.

      "Excellent Replacement\n",
      "I bought a large RF-1200 to replace two RF-1000s that were each more than six years old. Enormous difference! Perceptibly lighter, quieter, and smaller than the RF-1000s. My first experience with a Pinlock visor and insert, which greatly reduced fogging. The RF-1200 visors are about half again more expensive than the RF-1000 visors, though they are larger and definitely more rigid. Also, the RF-1200 has a pop-open position that's narrower than the RF-1000 and more effective, I think, because it allows just enough air to flow without undue noise. None of my older neoprene visor sleeves fit the new visors so I'll have to find replacements for those. I replaced the 35mm cheek pads with 31mm cheek pads because the thicker pads felt uncomfortable for day-long rides (I have a average to thinner-than-average face). I think I'd use the thicker pads for a track day because they'd probably provide slightly more protection. Typical quality Shoei build that's well worth the price.\n",

I recently used the helmet on a 3 hour ride in 45 degree weather that combined both country roads and stop and start nyc driving and was very pleased with the helmet. The easy ventilation adjustability kept me comfortable and fog free throughout the ride. There was no whistling or wind noise at any speed. I was wearing a balaclava under the helmet, but I felt like I would have been fine with just a neck protector. The construction of the helmet is very high quality and the padding and fit are very comfortable.\n",

      "So I have used a RF700 for years and got tired of everyone telling me to upgrade. My old helmet was so comfortable but after realizing I was five generations behind, I knew I couldn't leave it any longer. The 1200 is way superior in terms of ventilation. Almost too good in fact. I left the little vent open at front and rode in Nov. My head was chilly. I also realized there was a draft over my eyes went I leaned over in a corner. Both were easily solved by closing all the vents and adjusting the face shield (two clicks on small screw). The latter brings the shield closer to the shell. I also installed the optional chin screen. Now everything is toasty.The 1200 has much better aerodynamics. The 700 would get pushed back into my face at speed, and move around if I looked over my shoulder. The 1200 is planted.The double glazed shield takes some getting used to, but it is nice to have the option. I am waiting to see the photochromic option out later this year.\n",

The smaller opening, however, contributes to much reduced wind noise compared to the RF1000. The interior comfort padding is full and comfy; I appreciate that the liner pieces come out for washing. My only criticism - a minor one - is that the little snap that fastens the chinstrap end is a bit fiddly to engage.\n",

The emergency cheek pad removable system was easily noted. The installation of my com system was quick, and easily due to the remove ability of the cheek pads, and the 3D liner. I had to basically disassemble the RF-1000 to remove the com's.The cutouts for the com system were found to be small for my system, but the speakers were placed over the padding and are very comfortable in this position. Upon ridding with the RF-1200, it was found to be quieter than the RF-1000. Helmet was very comfortable. First ride wear time of the helmet was over an hour. I never encountered a problem, no neck strain, or pressure points were noted. I will definitely recommend this helmet to others.\n",

      "This is my first helmet so unfortunately I can't compare it to anything else but I love the helmet. It's exactly what I was waiting for after weeks of research and watching the awesome videos here on all the different helmets.I'm not a big guy and on the skinny side so helmet shell size was very important to me. The rf1200 shell makes everything else on the market look huge and doesn't give you that goofy looking bobble-head look.The inside is plush and soft and is VERY warm. I wore it around the house for 30 mins to make sure it fit my head right and my whole body was sweating from the warmth of the helmet. Then I opened the vents and just by walking at a fast pace cooled my head down. I'm an intermediate to long oval and it hugs my head perfectly in all areas. That leads me to believe that it might be too narrow or long for an even slightly rounder head. If you have a round head, this helmet isn't for you.The fit and finish are top notch and you can just feel that it's a high quality helmet. The buckles are beefy and I don't see them ever breaking over time. The only con I noticed when wearing it was the bottom strap digging into my neck/chin area. I see that it has two soft pieces to guard against that but they aren't long enough or wide enough to work. That really annoyed me. It wasn't the irritating abrasive sensation that annoyed me- it was the fact that they thought of everything and couldn't think of a better design to keep that rough chin strap off of people's skin(which is crazy sensitive after a close shave). I've noticed that this seems to be the common design amongst different helmet brands but I can't help but think they'd be much more effective if the padding was more like a sleeve where it was sleeved over the strap vs flaps that never stay in place. Or simply thicker, wider and longer cushioning in that area might do the trick. That way you wouldn't have soft and plush around the head and cheeks to rough and abrasive under the chin(which really is distracting. Maybe it's just something I need to get used to or something that will soften up over time. But to not beat a dead horse, there's no reason why such an elementary design for that strap should still be on these modern helmets after all the cutting edge technology and calculated design that went into this(and other modern higher end helmets).With the above complaint said, I feel like the helmet was literally molded for my head. THATS how comfortable it is. It's light, doesn't have a bobble-head effect, soft, warm, looks aggressive and badass, DOT and SNELL approved for under $450....what more could you ask for? Oh ya, a better chin strap protector! Haha...but that's the only thing.\n",

      "Head protection is a must to me and I wanted to invest in a good all around helmet. At first I was between the Shoei RF 1100 and the Bell RS1. I like to read reviews often in different online stores before I make purchases. Long story short I was going to purchase an RS-1 but right when I got around to buying it, this helmet came out and I am happy it did!This was actually my first helmet so I couldnt say much for others but it was apparent when I got this helmet the build quality was extremely top knotch. Nothing on this helmet feels cheat or flimsy. The vents are solid and do their job very well. The ratcheting face sheild also feels solid and clicks as it goes up or down. The fit is great on my oval head and super comfy and secure. I wear a size medium.The major thing that sold me on this was the extras and the fixes Shoei did from their previous helmet the RF-1100. It was in my top two choices but I heard the venting wasnt great and the wind noise was horrible. Plus no pin lock.With this helmet Shoei addressed all the issues. This comes with a pinlock system and lens! Its fairly quiet at normal speeds and the matte black looks killer!I was aware Shoei was a top name in helmets and I'm glad a made a good choice for my heads safety and for investment sake.Seriously save the money and get this! You'll be glad you did.\n",

      "I've owned 2 helmets before this (Bell Vortex, RF-1100) and I must say, even over the RF-1100, this helmet is the peak of helmet evolution (within it's price margin of course). It's wonderfully lightweight and compact shell looks sleek and feels great. The RF-1200 has superior venting over the RF-1100 (depending on your riding position) AND comes with a pinlock shield. Although not as simple as Bell's shield removal system, it only takes about 25 seconds to remove and reinstall. This helmets feels like $437.39, which I definitely could not say for the Vortex (it felt like a $50 helmet). But the RF-1100 is not out of the game. Due to Revzilla's closeout sale of the RF-1100, the $100 price difference between two will divide those who want the new and improved vs. the old but still wonderful standard.\n",

      "Long story short, I bought this helmet not long after buying a cheaper helmet. For the price, the cheaper helmet was a good bargain, but I had the money to buy a nicer helmet, so I went ahead and did so. I figured my head was worth more than $125. I'm very glad I did, because I love this helmet. I'm new to the helmet and moto world, but I know quality and attention to detail. This helmet is pure quality. It feels, looks, and performs well worth the price. I got a size S in Matte Black and it fits and looks great. It's nice and snug. It's also very lightweight. You have a nice compact feeling when wearing it, like the helmet isn't any bigger than it needs to be, but still offering quality protection. The smaller shell profile is a plus. I've never worn any other Shoei models, so I can't compare it's performance to previous RF's, but I can attest to a few things; First, it's on the quiet side. The cheaper helmet I had would get noisy around 30+ mph, which for a new rider, makes it hard to be in tune with the sound of the engine. And on the highway, the lesser helmet caught air like crazy (it's a dual sport helmet, so some of that is forgivable). The 1200 is comfortable and reasonably quiet at higher speeds. I can hear my engine very well, and I can turn my head sideways without being pulled. Head checks are comfortable at speed. As for the vents, I haven't fooled around much with them, as the weather is getting cooler, but I did try the front defog/air intake vent last night, and it worked great. There's slight whistling when riding with the visor up sometimes, probably due to the placement of the visor redirecting wind. This is not a problem for me. The field of vision is excellent. I haven't used the pinlock lens that came with the helmet, yet. The included breathe guard and chin skirt, which I installed immediately, I am very happy with. These accessories are a great addition. Also, the 5 year warranty offers good peace of mind. Overall, the RF-1200 is a great helmet. It's well worth the asking price. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a quality helmet. A+\n",

      "It was time for a new helmet, and Shoei has always been a favorite brand based on fit. I initially planned to purchase the RF 1200 based on previously owning an RF 1100, as well as all the great reviews by Revzilla and it's customers. But, the RF1200, just doesn't fit my head properly, and causes pressure spots on the top corners of my head. The RF SR however, has a slightly different fit, and is perfect on my head. Both are listed as intermediate oval, but after trying a bunch on at my local dealer, as well as emailing the crew at Revzilla, they confirmed that the shapes are slightly different. I have to say that the RF SR, in my opinion, seems just as quality as the RF 1200, and besides some of the aesthetics, it has almost all the same features, minus some of the venting differences. It also uses the same shield as the RF 1200, and I was therefore able to get the transition lens. I highly recommend this helmet, and you'll save about $85, which wasn't my motivation, but it's a nice chunk of cash to put towards the expensive transition lens. At the end of the day, you have to go with what fits your head properly, and this one does that for me. Couldn't be happier.\n",

But the Bullitt was just way to round and tight for me in a Small, which is the size I need. spent a lot of time trying helmets on locally, and found a place that carried the RF-SR, but only in a Medium. It was too loose, but I liked the helmet overall, so I took a chance, and ordered a Small from here. It fit PERFECTLY. I really, really like this helmet. It has a huge field of vision, it is really comfortable, and the vents work as advertised. I only have too small gripes. First, it's too hot out right now to use the face shield (I do wear sunglasses), and so much air comes in through the side of the port that it makes my eyes water badly at highway speed. Goggles would probably solve this, but I haven't tried any yet. My second (minor) complaint is that I wish the helmet came in more finishes. I went with the Basalt Grey, but I wish they offered a hi viz/hazard orange, and at least a couple of graphics choices. Still, the grey does look great, and I am ultimately happy with my choice. I wear earplugs when I ride, so any excess noise/whistling that may be caused by my the helmet isn't an issue for me.\n",

      "I might just have to argue this is the best (premium) entry cruiser helmet you can get right now.  Do you get drop down visors and flip up modularity, or built in coms? no.  What you do get is absolute attention to detail and craftsmanship.  The quality of the finish, padding, and down to the air vents is noticeable.  Nothing feels cheap nothing rattles and the visor doesn't feel like a cheap toy when using it.  The fit is true and comfortable, the ride is quiet but not whisper quiet.  You get good airflow for that little extra noise.  IMO that perfect balance between airflow and noise is achieved here.  Typically if you get a really cool helmet it's going to be very loud or vice versa a really quite helmet that is really hot.  Not so with the RF-SR.  Why not get the RF-1200? if you're riding a sport bike i would argue that you should step up to the 1200.  However if you're riding a cruiser like I am (iron 883) save the $100 and stay with the RF-SR.\n",

A proper fitting helmet right out of the box! Quiet, super comfortable, aero dynamic (no more sore neck), no hot spots and no red marks or imprints on my forehead. I just love wearing this helmet!I have wasted $700 to $900 in the past on Arai helmets and wanted to tear them off and toss them to the roadside. The only thing I wish is that the bottom vent went to my face instead of the face shield. The top vents do an exceptional job. The Airmada spoiled me with the chin vents, but there is no comparison to the Shoei with the ventilation to the top of the head. I wore a large Airmada for a few years. Then I recently ordered a new one in medium and it topped out on my forehead and left a red ring around the top of my forehead, plus I thought my ears were going come off before I could get the helmet off.  I wore it indoors for hours. In my experience a helmet that doesn’t fit properly to your head shape NEVER “breaks in”.Many thanks to Revzilla for taking the Airmada back.\n",

      "Fantastic helmet\n",
      "So, I was looking at buying either the Shoei RF-1200 or the RF-SR.  Due to riding a cruiser with an upright riding style, I opted for the RF-SR and I don’t regret that decision at all.  Based off the sizing chart on Revzilla, I fell in between the medium and the large.  Upon further investigation on the Shoei website, I saw that a medium goes up to a size of 7 ¼, which has always been my hat size and was a perfect fit.  The fitment is intermediate-oval and the supplied thickness of the internal padding is perfect and provides a wonderful fit.  Having only had a few other cheap helmets to compare this to the weight of this helmet is very impressive.  I never have issues even with the longest of rides of any discomfort from the helmet being heavy nor any pinching of the ears, which I have experienced with my other helmets.  The field of vision with this helmet is spectacular and I opted to buy the pinlock to avoid any potential fogging issues, but up to this point I have not tested the pinlock.  Removal of the visor is simple and can be done in a matter of seconds.  The visor has great detents and can be partially opened to assist with greater airflow on hotter days and closes very tightly.  Operation of the visor is easily done with gloves on.  As far as noise levels, I wear earplugs regularly, but I did go for a short spin without to determine the noise level.  I have a thunder-header exhaust, which is on the loud side, but the helmet did a fantastic job at making it completely tolerable at normal cursing speeds.  Being behind a fairing motorcycle, gauging airflow can be difficult, but I absolutely felt tons of fresh air coming in from the top vents.  I have left the chin curtain out and did notice a fair amount of air coming in from the bottom, but given the current temperatures this was not a problem for me, but I do suspect come colder weather I will have to add the curtain.  All the vents can be easily operated with gloves on.  Removal of the internal liner to install a Sena was easily completed and the speakers fit great.  Re-installation was just as easy.  My only complaint, which is not about the helmet, is Shoei charging another 65$ for the dark smoke visor.  Otherwise for the price of the helmet alone and the above reasons, I fully recommend this helmet!\n",

      "I have been searching for the perfect helmet for a couple of years.  I bought my last helmet in 2011 - the Bell Vortex.  Though heavy (4.1lbs), the photochromic shield really spoiled me but the internal guts and were starting to get gross and I was wanting something lighter.I was looking at the RPHA 11 Pro, the Simpson Mod Bandit, the RPHA 70ST, Bell SRT, the Shoei Neotec II, the Shoei RF-1200, etc.  I drive an FZ1 with bar risers and completely setup for touring.  After reading some reviews around the speciality of sport touring for this particular helmet.  I finally made the leap and got the Matte Grey with the Photochromic Shield; about $670 all-in (GASP).  So far, it has blown away my expectations.  The feeling of the premium materials, the beauty of the paint job, the weight, the airflow, etc - it makes this such an amazing lid.  Even the detents on the shield and how premium the shield feels vs my old Bell has really blown me away.\n",

      "I don't really have anything to compare it to since it's my first helmet, but I've been really happy with it so far. The ventilation seems good and is easily adjusted with gloves on once you know where it all is, and at least on my head, it's super, super comfortable – friends said they've had helmets that gave them a headache, and that's not happening to me at all. It felt heavy at first, but again, that's probably a helmet thing, and I have nothing else to compare it to – I don't really notice this anymore.Some things I noticed that are probably true of any helmet and also probably better than most with the RF-SR: 1) vision is good generally, but peripheral vision is a little restricted and I have a little bit of trouble turning to look over my shoulder or see behind me when stopped or going slow in a parking lot, 2) it feels pretty claustrophobic with the shield down, 3) pinlock is VERY hard to install (I may have been doing it wrong, but I thought I was going to break it!), and 4) instructions for maintenance and care aren't super clear, so I have some research to do on that front given that I am a newbie.I have the Sena SMH-5, and installing this was a breeze thanks to the removable pads in the helmet. I did have to remove more padding than I thought to accommodate the speakers, but it wasn't a big deal after watching some youtube videos going over the install. It sounds great – I assume this helmet is pretty quiet, since I found myself actually turning down the volume after my bro-in-law borrowed the controller unit (I think his battery was dead, but he also has the SMH-5 installed in his Arai).  It does whistle some, but earplugs cut that almost completely.\n",

      "Overall great helmet, especially for upright bikes\n",
      "I switched from a Shoei Qwest to this helmet and it made a world of difference for me.I started off riding sportbikes, and the Qwest was fine for that, if slightly loud. Then I bought an XSR900 with a very upright riding position, and the Qwest became unbearable. It was really loud in that position and had a ton of lift at highway speeds (65-70 mph) - the helmet fit correctly so it wasn't really moving on my head, but it felt like it was trying to pull my head up off of my shoulders. I do wear a size 2XL (head measures 63.5cm) so that probably doesn't help, but it was very uncomfortable.The RF-SR fixed all of that. It has barely any lift up to 90-95 mph, and is tolerable all the way up to 120. It's also way quieter than the Qwest was. This is seriously the helmet to go with for any sort of upright riding, I can't recommend it enough.I have two minor nitpicks, neither of which really are a big deal. The first is stylistically, I bought the white helmet for a more retro look and honestly it looks like crap because of all the black vents. They really need to be painted white, because it looks like you have a set of bug antennae coming up from the visor. I masked them off and plasti-dipped them with a few coats of white and the helmet looks a million times better now. If you get the black or maybe blue colors, it wouldn't look bad, but the lighter colors all look pretty stupid with all of the black plastic that's on them.The other is that even though this is supposedly an intermediate oval, it's much tighter lengthwise than my Qwest (which is a round oval). It fits fine side-to-side, but front-to-back is really tight to the extent that if I make a kissing expression my lips will be touching the inside of the chin piece. It's not really a problem, but it did take some getting used to at first.The one other cool thing is that it comes with a pinlock visor and anti-fog insert for it, which saves an extra $100 I would have had to shell out. Overall this helmet is great and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Great helmet - Much quieter than before.\n",
      "My old helmet had “stale dated.”  I had a Bell Qualifier DLX which had two great features.  One it had a Transitions shield, two it incorporated the Sena SM unit into the helmet via a cut out.  Trouble was it was noisy!  I wanted something that was quieter.  The Shoei RF-SR comes with pin lock and is reported to be quiet.  Nice mid-level price point. I ride a cruiser with a fairing, and an ADV style bike with a wind shield.  The RF-SR is designed for more upright position than the RF-1200, so it seemed like the logical choice.  I elected to buy the Transitions shield; still with pin lock and installed the Sena with no problems.    The fit is slightly better than the Bell.  Same size, so size runs “true.” I wear glasses; no problems there.  There is a cut out for speakers; no problems there.  A touch more comfortable than the Bell, less pressure on the forehead.  I suspect as it is worn more, it will conform a bit better.  First ride impressions?   Well, it was cold enough to try the pin lock.  That is a great feature.  As to the sound? Much much quieter.  Volume on the tunes is down lower, ambient noise is much lower.  Likely will have re-calibrate my “internal speedometer” as it is quieter than before at 65 mph or so.   Very nice.  Big improvement over the Bell and can recommend without a doubt.\n",

      "This helmet was not my first choice as I was a completely newbie and wanted something cheaper to start with. I got scorpion helmet per the online recommendation, but the sales person got me to try this one (orange to fit my ktm). I struggled with the price for a while, and I event took both home and wearing them inside the house to see if there were noticeable difference. And there are, quite so. My head needs a large helmet, and the large helmet from other brand just seems so much bulkier (XXL shell). For shoei, it was very slim and light. I didn't feel any momentum while turning my head, which helped reducing neck stress. I ended up with this one and returning the other one. I have been riding with it for almost a year, and I am really pleased with the quality of the build. Aside from safety and structure which I cannot test, I love the paint, the protection layer, the mesh, pads inside the helmet. In conclusion, for beginner, don't be scared to pay more for the first helmet. Try it on. And if you like it, it might be the last helmet you need.\n",

      "The lining is very plush and comfortable.The cheek and neck pads do a good job of not ripping your ears off while putting the helmet on.The noise level seems quiet, but this is my first non-modular helmet. It is much quieter than my hjc modular. The wind is almost inaudible below 50mph. At 80mph, it isn't loud enough to get annoying or cause damage or ear ringing.The aerodynamics seem pretty good. I can look up and down without much change in drag. Looking 90deg to either side does increase drag (unavoidable), but it's not too bad. The chin curtain is great for keeping wind off your face.The nose cone thingy is great for preventing fog up on the lens. Both are removable if you don't want them.I got the matte blue shell and a \"dark smoke\" cwr-1 lens (+$60). The lens is dark enough for daytime but still works surprisingly well at night. My girlfriend got glossy white shell with the fire reflective lens. It looks awesome.The vent actuators are very well designed. They are easy to open and close, with a long range of motion and a nice click to confirm changes. The chin vent pushes are both into your mouth area and up onto the inside of the shield. Opening this vent doesn't affect noise level much, which is nice. The forehead vents are well sized. They also do not cause much increase in noise level. Very pleased with that.My only complaint is the face shield mechanism. It doesn't have a real \"positive lock\" type of motion to seal up the shield against the gasket. There is an adjusting mechanism that will change the spring tension, so be ready to adjust that. There are two screws that fasten each of the two shield mounts (left and right) to the shell. These mounts can be moved around a little bit by loosening the fastening screws then re-tightening when done. My advice is to push the mounts all the way towards the back, so the shield will be pressed more firmly into the gasket around the face. After you do this, you can adjust the spring tension mechanism to your liking.If the price doesn't scare you, you will definitely not be disappointed. The snell rating and comfort level are worth the price.If the price does scare you but you need snell, I'd say go with a scorpion exo, you'll get the snell rating for sub $200.\n",

      "Helmet is a good choice for any type of experienced rider.     I was concerned about how tight the Medium Size might be when I tried them on at a cycle shop.  The online size chart here at RevZilla said my size was a medium but it seemed tight in the store. The shop did not have the color I wanted so I ordered it here.  Plus free shipping and free return if it didn't work out for me.    Once it arrived it seemed tight too.  HOWEVER, by the end of the my first ride using the RF-SR (it was a 325 mile ride) it seem like a perfect fit!  The next ride a week later was 300 miles and I had no issues with the fit at all.   Helmet is a lot quieter than my current modular,  So, I am no longer wearing ear plugs.  Besides, I planning on installing a Sena SMH-10 Bluetooth Headset so they won't be needed.    The Good:       Everything about the helmet so far, the build, comfort, features etc.  And it does come with the Pin Lock interior shield!     It saves you money over the RF-1200. If that matters to you.  It did me.  I almost order the RF-1200 but changed my mind at the last minute.    The Bad:      Nothing really bad BUT, the dark shield is extra... It would be nice if they would either give you the option of the shield you wanted or include booth a clear and a dark shield.  Oh well...   Good Luck with your choice and Ride Safe!\n",

I have a 2010 Harley Davidson Fat Bob and I really wanted the protection of a full face helmet without the usual flashiness of most sport bike oriented full faced helmets. The styling of this helmet is simple and doesn't look out of place when riding on a cruiser. A great thing about this helmet is that it vents really well for the upright riding position so I don't have angle my head in any weird way to get breeze going though. The PinLock system works flawlessly, I never have a problem with the visor fogging up. I am relativly new to the full face market so its hard to judge Noise Level but I really dont have a problem with it. I can keep the visor up until around 35-40 miles until it starts whistling too much and then once I close the visor the noise is cut down significantly with no whistling. The helmet will get louder if your doing head checks but nothing that is unbearable or long enough for me to really care about. I bought the Matte Black, however I have seen the Matte Blue in person and I love it as much as the black. Hope this helped, I would definitely recommend this Helmet.\n",

      "In case you don't want to read the entire review, here's the summary:Pros- Comfortable- Light- Quiet, I think?- Removable pads- Good field of view- Good air flow- Looks cool- Price is rightCons- Selection of face shields limited- Doesn't come in a lot of different colors- Airflow at the top of the head not as good as RF1200 (to be expected I suppose)I believe I read this helmet is more focused on the street riders who aren't necessarily hitting the track on the weekends.  It's supposedly geared towards those who have a more upright seating position.  I can see that.I used to ride a 2004 R1 and had a Shoei RF-1200.  After putting over 36k on that bad boy and enduring the harsh leaning forward seating position for years, I moved over to an FZ-07 and the RF-SR.  My back is thanking me.The RF-SR is light, comfortable, has a good field of view, moves air well, is affordable, and looks cool.  The airflow over your head isn't as good as the RF-1200, but this isn't a racing helmet and it's much cheaper so, that's understandable.  Still, I kinda miss the cooling effect the RF-1200 had.  You still stay cool in hot weather though, the helmet does have good air flow especially for the face.   The removable cheek pads are a nice touch.  You can wash the pads or replace them with a smaller size.  I would say this helmet has a quiet ride, but I'm always wearing earplugs so, I don't know.  The helmet looks awesome.  I have the matte black and I'm happy with that.  Probably the best thing about this helmet is the price.  Shoei is a great company, and to get one of their helmets for 300 dollars is a damn beautiful thing.There's no point going into the cons as they are me being picky.  This is a great helmet and I would recommend it to anyone.\n",

      "I have used 3/4 helmets since riding from '70, so this is mostly a comparison with that type of helmet. I ride a HD Super Glide and getting old and cold this year I thought it's time to try a FF helmet. Really like this helmet for the most part. I can't compare this one with other FF, but it's no buffeting, comfortable and quiet. Only thing I noticed was this FF helmet opening comes closer to my eyes and I need to turn my head more to see behind me, where the 3/4 had a wider opening. Nothing I can't get used and noticed other FF helmets seems to be the same. Great helmet for riding in the cold. I'll see how it does in warmer weather.  I would buy this helmet again.I will give a plug for Revzilla. I only bought this helmet from watching review videos on this site. To me, all the reviews address my questions. Thanks.\n",

      "I replaced my Shoei Qwest with the RF-SR. As far as $400 helmets go, this is about as good as it gets. Build quality is on par with other Shoei helmets. Definitely louder than the Qwest but way better airflow.My YT video comparing the RF-SR and Qwest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWcwHBIr8sUPros:-Awesome airflow-Snell and DOT approved-Pinlock visor and insert included-Very comfortable-Easy to install Bluetooth communicatorsCons:-Louder than most $400 helmets (louder than my Qwest)-Only solid color ways\n",

      "Better than Qwest\n",
      "I bought this to replace my Qwest and i'm pleased i did. Its nice and quiet and comfortable and i feel safe and secure wearing it. No real buffering when riding the highway at 60mph plus. I've had several helmets and this is one of the quietest. Cheek pads were tight when new but they compress fairly quickly with use so don't worry. If you have tried on the SR 1200 buy a size smaller in this as the internal shape is different and its def more roomy.\n",

      "My First Shoei Helmet, and I LOVE IT\n",
      "Ridding Conditions:   I ride in Portland Oregon, so we get plenty of rain and decently cool days. Rain is the big one here and this helmet does not leak from the top vents or visor when slightly open to completely closed.  To be fair I have a full fairing on my old BMW r100rt, so that captures a lot of the wind to begin with.   Bang for your buck: Absolutely worth every penny as this helmet is packed with great features such as the E.Q.R.S, chin curtain,  breath guard, and many more features you typically don’t get in a mid to high end motorcycle helmet for this price point.  The overall weight is just right for my upright ridding style. Protection & Durability: Thankfully I have not laid my bike down or been in any accidents so I can’t give an honest account on the Protection but Durability seems to be good thus far.  I have just about put a full season of ridding in this helmet from hot summers to cool rain and it breathes and keeps me nice and cool.  The only minor complaint I have is with the color that I chose which was flat black. This is going to be prone to scratches but thankfully the helmet bag they provide in the box has done a good job keeping those at bay. Features: Many features and my favorite is without a doubt the visor with pinlock and overall visibility. Lets be honest here we are not going to be putting on a helmet for the hell of it we want something to protect us and we also want the ability to see without something blocking our peripheral vision.Comfort: This helmet in the summer time is alittle tight around my cheeks, but I could upgrade the cheek pads to take care of that so no issue there. Remember I have a medium helmet.  The overall comfort for ridding a full day is absolutely perfect.  Its honestly gotten to the point of wearing your favorite hat you just want to wear it. Style: Your probably not going to blow your friends away with the way this looks, but there again it serves its purpose.  It doesn’t have fancy racing spoilers and crazy designs and to be honest I’m thankful that it doesn’t.  The style is perfect for $399. Noise Level: I have no complaints with this helmet when it comes to noise level.  Its quiet and can actually hear myself talk without being drowned out by wind notice or raindrops hitting the top of my helmet.  This helmet is very quiet but you can still hear traffic around you so your not completely numb to your hearing senses. Finally Overall Recommendation: I would say you should certainly try this helmet on first, as it seem to be tight at least for me in the cheek area. With that aside this helmet is absolutely perfect in just about every way.  It has every feature I love especially having the pinlock system and that is provided in box. Please do note though that on the outer edge of the pinlock, which is hard to see unless you really try will fog up every once and awhile. Simple fix for that is to creak your visor open and it will clear right up. I fully suspect that this isn’t the only helmet that has this, so I don’t consider this an imperfection and it in no way impedes my vision while ridding.  I would highly recommend this helmet for not only its price point, or Shoei’s great attention to detail, but just for the fact that this helmet really is comfortable, quiet and will get the job done.   The D ring on the chin strap is near to impossible to close with ridding gloves on so fair warning, put the helmet on before putting your gloves on that simple.\n",

      "My first Shoei\n",
      "First of all, I did not buy this from Revzilla, sorry. I got it for the same price from another supplier, but I was able to try it on in person alongside of many other helmets.  I wore this helmet around the store for probably half an hour before taking it home.  Felt no pressure points and still can report that this is a great helmet.  Fits great, feels great (and it looks good - the matte blue is SHARP). This helmet fits my similar to the Arai Signet X.  TBH, the Arai was like wearing a cloud on my head, but this Shoei is $200 less and fit within a few degrees of the Arai.  I don't know if that makes me a round oval or round head, but I am mixed Asian-American and previously HJCs fit my head the best, probably because they're a Korean company making helmets based on the heads they know. I did try the RF-1200 because they have great style and tons of amazing reviews, but it was TOO tight in the cheeks and across forehead. It felt like it was stretching my vision.  If you find the RF-1200 to be a little bit too tight, maybe because you're not full Western European descended, this might be your answer.Active airflow was surprisingly good despite only having 3  intake vents: 2 on the head and the chin vent.  I don't know really how quiet this is.  There's definitely wind noise, but not so loud that I'm completely in a tunnel, but sometimes when I read reviews about the quietness of a helmet, it sounds like we're all expecting zero wind.  Maybe one day we'll get there, but not today.  The wind in this helmet is not really noticeable until around 50 mph.  Then it sounds like being in a car with the windows down.  Which, as I understand, is normal.  No weird whistlings or anything like that.The visor is great and comes with pinlock.  The visor has a good field of vision and strong detents.  Love the detents!  My HJC's detents would slam down on me as soon as I got going over 10MPH.I'm really pleased with this purchase and my only regret is that I didn't get it from here.\n",

      "Great Helmet for Scooter riders!\n",
      "I ride a Vespa 300 GTS and I needed a helmet for upright riding that was light weight, good field of vision, and quiet. It is not an easy task to find all 3 qualities in a helmet that was also for an upright scooter rider. I tried 2 half helmets but when I went over 55 miles per hour the wind noise was too much. Then I tried the Bell Bullett and it was good but also the wind noise was too loud. So after spending about $900 on a few helmets I bought the Shoei RF-SR helmet and it's the perfect helmet. Now when I travel 75-80 mph the wind is not an issue. If you're a cafe racer or a scooter rider this  is an awesome helmet. It's not too sporty looking and it's quiet at freeway speeds. Love this helmet!\n",

      "RF-SR not same size as RF-1200\n",
      "Guys I just bought this helmet so this a short review.Anthony says the sizing for both the RF-SR and the RF-1200. This is not true. The RF-1200 had a much narrower fit. The cheek pads were so tight I was literally biting down on the insides of my cheeks. It was solved by changing the pads size which was an extra $50. The pressure on the back of my head was also tighter.In the end I took the SR. mainly because if the price differences. But the helmet feels slighted larger and am actually on my way back to Revzilla for larger pads.In a Nutshell these two helmets do not have identical sizing.\n",

I got the orange,  beautiful do finishes and paint. I could not be happier with the product and the price is right for the overall quality.\n",

      "Great Replacement for Shoei Qwest\n",
      "Ok. I pre-ordered this helmet on Revzilla. Once I received it I heard that it wasn't as good as the RF-1200, there is a whistling sound and not that quiet. Took me a little longer to get my bike so was nervous I spent 399 here and wouldn't be able to exchange it.Well worry no more. Picked up my Z650 and rode out with this helmet. Once I dropped the visor, very little sound. The most I did was 50 mph and still was quiet and no fog. Its a great improvement of the Shoei Qwest. Hands down.The way the helmet fits is snug but comfortable. After awhile of riding I forgot I had a helmet on.\n",

      "Excellent all-around helmet\n",
      "For starters, I didn't purchase this from Revzilla. I needed a Snell helmet for a track day event and bought it from the store I tried it on at. I spent over an hour trying on every make and model of helmets they had and narrowed it down to this one for it's perfect fit. AVG was very comfy too, but not Snell rated. My head shape is an intermediate-oval, the same as the majority of head shapes. This fit the same as the RF-1200, along with many Aria and AVG.  I was able to stuff my melon into a size medium, but was too tight a fit. But it didn't have any pressure points, which surprised me. I got a size large (head measurements are at the bottom).I ride around for a bit on my sv650s, and I didn't notice it at all on my head. I turned to look behind getting on the freeway and the helmet didn't do a thing. Aerodynamics are exceptional. There is barely any wind buffering. Closing the visor leaves me in my own little space, the seal and clamping force working so well with the thick, optic-grade visor.  The field of view is slightly wider than the many helmets I tried on. The chin is shaped nicely so I don't hit my shoulders with it while looking behind, I would guess it also helps with cutting through the wind. On my track day, it was 45F, and raining. I didn't have the pinlock in yet, I could say I wanted to see what difference it could make, but honestly I just forgot to put it in. The visor fogged pretty easily along with my glasses. Having to leave it cracked didn't let much water in, but after a few sessions I installed the included Evo pinlock. I still had to leave the visor cracked open while in the pits for my glasses, but once I got going I could fully close it, only using the chin vent. It remained fog free while huffing and puffing in the cold rain. I'm very impressed. The rest of the helmet remained dry, the two front vents sealing out the rain. My neck remained unstrained, thanks to the light weight and great aerodynamics up to 100 mph.I like the way it looks on me, too. Shoei used more shell sizes like Aria does to tailor the fit. With the size large, I'm not wearing a shell that fits LG-3XL like I was before. The profile is slimmer and weight is reduced. I have the flat black, it was the only one in stock, but it's growing on me.I appreciate the safety features also, from the emergency release pulls on the neck sides for the  padding so EMT's don't have to struggle to remove it, to the multi-layer eps foam.I think Shoei's quick release/install visor system works okay, but just make sure it's fully on and closes. I thought I had it secured, and when I flipped it down it popped off. Used to do the same thing on my RF-800. The replacement visor selection is not ideal, a faintly metallic silver or gold costs 1/4th the price of the helmet! And that's not including the pinlock!!! But wow are they perfectly made, and the helmet feels like quite a bargain that an extra cool visor is not that extravagant.Just for you, I used two framing squares as calipers to measure my  head: front to back is 8 1/8\", side to side is 6 1/8\"  Circumference is 23.5\"Safe riding!Chris\n",

      "i didnt buy it at revzilla, but this is the only helmet that fits my head with no pressure points and i can also wear glasses in it. i got it also with the transitions shield and mounted pinlock before first use. the helmet is light and solidly built (i guess shoei stands for their helmet as they give 5year warranty). chin guard is also inluded.the orange color fits my ktm well :) i can only compare it to my LS2 and shoeis' quality feel plays completely different game.the only downside is the D-ring strap - i wish the strap with D-rings was a bit longer. but i have to get used to it coming from quick release.\n",

      "Absolutely love it, wanted a GT-Air II, bought this instead!\n",
      "Had always used cheap helmets, but decided i wanted something with some more features that was a bit more comfortable and quiet. Had read thousands of reviews and decided in my head that I wanted a Shoei GT-Air II, so went to the shop to try it on. It squished my cheeks together so much i felt like i was about to dislocate my jaw - so much disappointment!I wear eye glasses, so needed something to accommodate that, and did not want to have to switch between my normal eye glasses and my prescription sunglasses, hence the drop down visor was a must have, also had to fit my glasses comfortably, both things this helmet excels at.It is also lighter than the Shoei - big plus! Visor works excellently, super easy to use and much prefer its location on the cheek than up near the visor mount. Visor is easy to get on and off, Pinlock works excellently (some 0 degree days can attest to that) and ventilation is excellent also. I have nothing but praise for this helmet, I was initially apprehensive going for a lesser known brand, but have been nothing but pleased. Have tried friends Arai's etc. and still prefer my HJC! And at $300AUD cheaper than the GT-Air II, absolute bargain.Do yourself a favour and by this helmet. There may be helmets that are better at one specific task than this, but if you want the best 'all-round' helmet for your tourer/sports-tourer, then this is it, works excellently for my daily commute on a GPZ750t!\n",

      "Overall I'm happy with the helmet. I'm a new rider so I don't have a lot to compare to other than an ancient Bell I used to have. I expected to get more airflow from the vents than what I experienced but it is a full face helmet. What I super dig is the drop shades, though when I first got the helmet there was some binding in both directions. That has seemed to take care of itself and with the included anti fog insert it's been pleasant to wear on the road.\n",

      "I really like this helmet.  Bought it in April and have replaced the faceshield 3x and need to replace it again.It keeps cracking where the metal release meets the rest of the plastic of the face shield.  The first one shattered completely.  The rest just have cracks that will eventually shatter.  Needless to say, this would be a very bad situation on the road.Based on the issues I have had, Im stepping away from this helmet and HJC as a whole.I wouldn't recommend any of the faceshields with this aluminum clasp as part of the faceshield.  It will just result is stress cracks.\n",

      "Not nearly as good as previous model.\n",
      "I bought this one to replace my RPHA ST that saved my noggin in a crash. Landed on my top front left in a flip. No head injury, neck pain or anything. Did a great job. So I bought this newer model. It looks a little better and has better airflow but all else is inferior. It's louder. Doesn't come with pinlock insert. Sun shield is awkward to use, less protective from wind and debris and it's a dull gray that makes it seem overcast when it's sunny out. When you close the visor all the way there is a vacuum created that is loud and really uncomfortable. It fogs up really easy even on clear warm days. The chin guard is a joke and I have to ride with visor vented even on cold days or in the rain. So basically I need another helmet for inclement weather. The foam by the ears makes horrible annoying sounds just like my 4 yr old Scorpion started doing. This helmet is 4 months old and the foam appears to be degrading already. And lastly the vents and visor are all awkward to use while riding/gloves on. And I couldn't tell you half the time if they are open or not. Definitely not a good helmet for the price. I'm shocked how inferior this is. Spend half as much for a Scorpion and get slightly better quality.\n",

      "Light weight helmet had too size up to an extra large when I normally wear a large,much better fit. Good field of view for doing lane checks and awareness.  Two things I wish were better if the detente for the visor were stronger it would be almost perfect. But I've had times when I've had the visor open and hit a bump and the visor shuts. The slider for the sun shield could use a detent for open and closed. As far as how quiet it is, if you have a naked bike I think it will be loud no matter what. If the top vent is open. If you have a properly adjusted windscreen or an adjustable screen you can make it as loud or as quiet as you want. Overall I like the helmet and I'm glad I purchased it.\n",

      "I've had one ride to work in the helmet so far, so thought I'd share my initial observations.    Quick summary is that I really like this helmet.  It fits well, looks good and does that it's supposed to.Here's a few more details.  First, let me start with the positives:- The helmet is very comfortable.  It is tight to get on, but once on there it's great.  I used to have neck strain with my previous helmet and that's gone now.- Visor is very smooth operating.  I appreciate the positive engagement when clicking it down.- I like that we have ECE on an internal-visor helmet.  This makes me feel a bit better than just DOT.Now some negative things I noticed:- Fogging - you really need to put the pinlock insert in.  I was hoping to be able to do without it until the cooler fall, but even in my 50F morning commute it fogged up like you wouldn't believe.  I'm definitely putting the pinlock in tonight.- The latch for the visor is in the middle and I noticed it gets in the way when scanning my speedometer.  Not a big deal, just need to pivot my head more; but I did notice it.- I get a bit more wind noise than in my previous helmet, but it's not too bad.  I wear earplugs anyway.And some observations (neither positive or negative):- I got white solid so I could put some vinyl graphics on and was able to easily peal off the front logo but the rear 'R' logo is thinner so doesn't come off as well.  I'll probably have to pick at that for a while.\n",

      "Great features, minor QA issues\n",
      "My wife and I have owned four RPHA 70 ST helmets.We RMA'd the first two:- Helmet A: After several months of use, the gasket at the top of the viewport was unrolling and putting pressure on the face shield, so it wouldn't latch anymore.- Helmet B: The high-vis markings on the top of the helmet faded to white after one season of use. It also suffered from face shield latching issues, and the pinlock (\"Skipfog\") insert didn't seal properly.- Helmet C (replacement for A): The Skipfog insert doesn't seal properly.- Helmet D (replacement for B): The Skipfog insert doesn't seal properly.The Skipfog insert is slightly too large to fit between the top centre ridge of the face shield and the latch plate at the bottom centre of the face shield. As a result, it's finicky to put in, and generally lets moisture in at the top or the bottom (not both). I think I may have it positioned right on Helmet D now, because it worked properly on my most recent rainy ride. Time will tell.Aside from QA issues, the helmet is excellent.• The ventilation actually works. The chin vent blows air across the inside of the face shield. The top vent blows three spots of cool air at the top of the head.• The drop-down visor is a snap to use, and dark enough. I would never own another helmet without this feature.• They accommodate communicaton systems well:   • The speaker recesses are -just- big enough for Cardo's Packtalk Bold JBL speakers. They handle the Sena SMH-10C speakers easily.   • Both Sena and Cardo systems mount fine on this helmet with the usual bracket. The drop-down visor switch doesn't get in the way at all.\n",

I ignored the advice on the video and had to return my first helmet as it was too small. Get the next size up.I used it today and found it comfortable and pretty quiet. It has  great vision and the drop down dark visor is a nice feature too.Overall I would say this is great value for the money.\n",

      "literally saved my life\n",
      "I originally purchased this helmet from a local bike shop, I liked the safety rating and internal sun visor, and the airflow and pinlock system was a plus. I had a good few months of riding in pretty much every condition from hot and sunny to cold with light snow falling and had absolutely zero complaints. About a week ago I was involved in a fairly serious accident where I went from 40mph into the back of a stopped car thanks to a kind gentlemen running a red light. The chin bar impacted the back of a station wagon hard enough to bend the structural metal there, and shatter the rear glass. I ended up with no facial or head injuries, no back or spine injuries, no signs of a concussion, and not even a bruise on my head. I just hit order on the exact same helmet as a replacement. Overall using the helmet I did not find it uncomfortable or loud, I do have a Sena 30k on it and have the speakers positioned directly over my ears, so that my help somewhat. The aerodynamics are much better than other helmets I've worn, though they are all lower budget HJC, I think this one has better aero sideways than others do facing forwards. The visor lock is a little difficult to find in gloves sometimes, not the end of the world though. Airflow is good, I've ridden from 30F to 105F in this helmet and it's been pretty good for me, gets a bit hot sitting in stop and go traffic in the summer, but I'm fairly sure anything would. I love the top vent adjustability, at speed, I feel it circulating air around the top of my head and it really works to cool you down.I don't know of a better way to end the review other than by saying I literally bought the exact same helmet after getting into an accident, at this price point and with the features this helmet has, I will probably be wearing one of these for quite some time.\n",

      "I just bought this helmet in matte titanium and so far I am happy with it. To be honest it is a little too soon to give a real review, I’ll have to come back after a season of riding. The quality looks and feels good so far, and Its a big improvement over my old GMax, which was less than half the price of the HJC.  The XL is a bit snug on my head but my last helmet was too loose so I might not be used to it. My head is just under 24”. The cheek pads are definitely tight, if they don’t break in I plan to replace them with the 25mm ones. Looks like revzilla has them for under $30. I could stand to loose a few pounds so this might not be an issue for others. I will say the shield seems to fog up quicker than I’d expect but that was without the free skipfog lens installed.\n",

      "I love this helmet due to the cushion design accommodating for prescription lenses. I can verify that the internal visor is far enough from your face that it won't collide with your glasses.I'm a female with a rather long oval head so I was worried about the shape, but it doesn't seem to be an issue. Also, the chin straps feel like they're nearly choking me. I have to pull them as far out as possible when putting on the helmet and they still dig into my neck. I haven't encountered this before with other brands of helmets.I removed a star due to two reasons:1. It's LOUD. Just going 45+ MPH without ear protection is straining. You should always be wearing something to protect your hearing, but when I first wore this helmet I didn't have any ear plugs and after just a minute of going 50-60 MPH I was getting rather annoyed at wind noise.2. The internal sun visor cable is super smooth, but taking the helmet off/on a couple times will lower my visor down by a little bit from all the movement. I have to use the lever to keep the visor up every now and then to prevent it from going into my field of view on cloudy days. It's a minor inconvenience, but I'm worried that over time the cable will become more loose as I have to continuously pull it with the lever.\n",

      "I got this helmet to replace my RF-1200 and am very happy with it. The ventilation is the absolute best of any helmet I have ever worn, especially the top vent which makes it feel like wind is bristling through my hair. It is also a little bit lighter than an RF-1200 even though it has a drop-down sun visor.My chief complaint about the RPHA 70 ST is that it fogs up too easily. Thanks to the complex shape of the face shield, even with a Pinlock lens (even a name-brand Pinlock) the bottom of the face shield will start to fog up on colder days and then start creeping up the face shield. On hot days this is not an issue, but it is pretty annoying on chilly morning commutes.\n",

This helmet is round oval. It is not true round, but this will NOT fit those on the longer side. You will realize very shortly after you put it on if you are longer oval.Better than GT-Air: compact shell, area below the shield is longer (covering more of your neck, a big benefit for ST helmets), much lighter, better neck roll coverage (again big for ST), way cheaperWorse than GT-Air: not QUITE as rock solid as a shoei, interior not QUITE as comfortableIf your noggin is round, there is no question this is a slam dunk in my opinion, and that is coming from a guy who had to return it. Long ovals don't even bother-trust me. Disregard my ratings for noise and air flow because I did not ride in it.*\n",

      "Just the Upgrade I Hoped For\n",
      "A brief one (for a change): After three pretty good years with my HJC CL-17 (and a lot of little knocks leaving it more than a little tattered), I decided to look for a serious upgrade in terms of weight, airflow, noise reduction and Bluetooth-friendliness. All the Good Stuff from the usual suspects were pretty far out of my price range, except for HJC's own RPHA 70 ST, which was still a *bit* beyond my budget, but I stretched to it because, well, it's about my head, yes? Long story short, the 70 ST is terrific, delivering on all the above expectations. A few hopefully-helpful notes:- In terms of fit, I'd heard that HJC's RPHA line differed from the rest of their helmets, even though the online size chart seemed to say otherwise. I took a chance and ordered the 70 ST in the same size as my CL-17 (Large, actually one size down from what the chart recommended for *that* helmet). The first time I put the RPHA on, I momentarily thought I'd made a mistake on sizing, but remembered that the CL-17 felt  pretty damned snug the first time I put *it* on, but eventually settled in to a very comfy fit. The 70 ST is the same deal, except that the Intermediate-Oval shape fits me even better than the CL-17's Round-Oval shape did. Even before \"breaking in\", the RPHA felt quite good once I actually had the thing on, and got better in a relatively short time.- The flip-down sunshade works beautifully, and doesn't run afoul of my eyeglasses (which, BTW, work just fine with this helmet). One interesting point for those with prescription Transitions lenses: the standard face shield apparently does not filter out all UV rays, as I noticed my lenses darkening in bright sun while riding. Believe it or not, I'm not complaining: This came in handy with my non-sun shade-equipped CL-17, and this means that I can likely forego using the 70 ST's built-in sun shade for all but the most-extreme conditions, but better to have it than not, I say. - Bluetooth: I'm quite happy that the 70 ST has cut-outs for BT comm speakers, because as a result of this helmet's smaller overall profile than the CL-17's (which had no cut-outs), I needed that extra bit of space, particularly for Sena's 3S-W, whose speakers also house the battery as well as most of the more-serious electronic guts of the unit, allowing the external control \"pod\" to be much less pod-like (i.e. much lower-profile) than their other models, but makes the speaker housings themselves chubbier. I can get my head in and out of the RPHA without my ears catching on one of the other speaker, although they do occasionally brush against them when first putting the helmet on. Once on, I feel no pressure against me ears. If the helmet works with this setup, almost anything else should be a breeze to fit.- Speaking of BT controls: Some have mentioned that locating the external BT control pod can potentially run afoul of the 70 ST's sun shade control. In my case, I simply located my comm's control farther to the back, which also works well interns of both removing and replacing the cheekpad on that side.In all, I'm very happy with this new lid, and can't imagine wanting for more - at least for now. :-)\n",

      "Not Happy with the Noise Level or Air Flow\n",
      "After reading many reviews about this helmet being a great helmet for 3/4 to full up I decided to make the switch from 3/4 to fullface. I ride a Cruiser and was looking for something that would help with the wind noise I was dealing with while wearing the 3/4. I also wanted something that would allow good airflow. I got neither of these with this helmet. Most reviewers talked about how great the noise level was with this helmet. They must have switched from a bicycle helmet or reviewed is while wearing it riding bicycle or walking around their bedroom. After putting 2000 miles in this helmet from short trips to a 700 mile weekend, I hate it. It is so loud even with hearing protection in it is still almost unbearable. The only way I found that reduces wind noise is to ride in the 3/4 position, if I wanted to do that I would have purchased a sport bike. As for airflow, what airflow. It has been 95* here for the past week with the visor completely closed my head is dripping with sweet within 7 miles of open roads, I need to crack the visor to allow airflow to cool me down. With the visor cracked to allow airflow the noise level is completely unbearable. Overall I am very unhappy with this helmet choice.\n",

Bottom line, If you are looking for a \"sport touring\" helmet that can do it all, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.\n",

But I've moved the mount for the Sena 30K back further to clear the cable and now it's perfect.  Oh did I mention that this helmet is quite.  I sometimes ride with the face shield cracked to let a lot of air in because my face is hot, but once you click it closed to me it's very quite...it even makes my loud ass exhaust even less loud.

      "I wanted to give this helmet a 5 star rating but it's not perfect. I got the Matte Titanium with the Silver Mirror Face Shield, which totally matches my Matte Grey Sportster. Love my helmet!I will start with the positive. Airflow is amazing, mainly because of the top vent. Not really sure if the top corner vents or rear exhaust really do anything but that top vent scoops a lot of air and cools my scalp. I \\have been shopping a helmet that has good ventilation for the summer, this helmet pretty much does it without costing over $600. The Internal Sun Visor is a plus but it has it's problems which I will explain next.OK, the negative. It doesn't get cold here in LA and humidity is pretty much non-existent. Rode this helmet the day after heavy raining. The Skipfog (which is included) does its job on my Face Shield but I noticed it was blurry when I brought down my Sun Visor. So I just didn't use my Sun Visor and my Silver Mirror Face Shield was good enough to block the sun. When I finally got home, I took off my helmet and notice that my Sun Visor was fogged up. Second, the sun visor doesn't go all the way down, not a huge problem but really noticeable if you are upright. Third, more of personal issue, I have big ears and I notice the tip of my ears binding a little. Kind of annoying but I got used to it.Great Helmet with great ventilation. The foggy Sun Visor is not going to be a problem for me because I live in a warm and dry climate here in Los Angeles but I can see it being a problem in humid and/or colder climates when the sun is out.

      "I purchased this helmet a couple of weeks ago and have put about 250 miles on it.  First thing I noticed is how light it is (no sore neck/shoulders) and how well it vents.  I am coming from a cheap modular helmet, so this one is leaps and bounds over my old one.  It is much quieter.  I can hear/understand my music/phone calls via my SENA SMH10 without having to crank it to max volume.  The shield seals very well, which definitely cuts down on noise.  Shield detents are solid and shield removal is so easy a caveman could do it.  Fit is true to size and very comfortable with no noticeable hot spots or pinch points.I don't care much for the position of the internal sun visor slider.  While it is silky smooth in operation, the location kind of gets in the way for Bluetooth mounts and is a little wonky to operate with a glove. Seems like HJC went for look over functionality with this one.One other gripe is the cheek pads.  While they are removable for cleaning, they are a pain in the neck to re-install.  I had trouble getting the snaps to snap back in.  It took way more effort that I think it should have (maybe its just me), especially if you clean your padding a lot.Overall a great helmet for the money, lots of features at a lower price point than similar helmets.

      "TL:DR - I am very satisfied and would buy it again.I was primarily cross-shopping this with the Shoei GT-Air as I wanted a well-ventilated full-face with a sun-visor. In my opinion, the RPHA 70 was better looking, and felt more comfortable on my head. I also prefer the center-lock visor. Other than that, the two helmets seemed very comparable despite their large price difference. I fortunately can't speak to protection yet (they bear the same ratings) or durability.The good:- The RPHA 70 is sexy in person if you like the aggressive look.. I got the semi-matte silver and it's gorgeous in person.- It's quite light, comfortable, and acceptably loud (read: not particularly quiet, but not notable at around-town speeds) - I haven't passed 120kph yet- The visor action is solid, sturdy, and seals very well. The latch is intuitive and easy. Removing/replacing is also impressively easy- Venting seems effective (if not game changing)- Sun visor is clear, easy and smooth to actuate, and appropriately tinted- Chin strap feels high quality- Reflective part of neck-roll is effective and a thoughtful addition- Emergency cheek-pad removal works pretty easily- Anti-fog visor insert included, easy to install, and seems to work (haven't ridden during any cold/humid nights yet though)- I've actually gotten compliments on the looks which surprised meSome minor complaints:- The actual lock mechanism on the visor latch seems a bit flimsy. The latch is very sturdy and I never actually use the lock so i wouldn't have noticed except for trying it out during unboxing.- The sun visor control could use a stronger 'click' in its up position. Mine has never fallen down, but I've accidentally lowered it a bit while just handling the helmet. The control may also interfere with side-mounted bluetooth positioning. Otherwise it's great, very smooth and intuitively located - The sun visor doesn't cover *quite* enough view at the bottom. I expected this and it doesn't bother me, but very particular people should try it out in person if this is a deal breaker.- All the vents are active, but I always leave them open. They feel sturdy but a touch over-engineered, I would be fine with just open vents (many would disagree with me I'm sure)- The included chin curtain seems to help some with noise, but isn't that big. It seems like a bit of an afterthought, but I leave it in. (There's also a very small one besides the removable one mounted at shipping).\n",

      "best thing since sliced bread... maybe not\n",
      "To start, this review is 100% first impressions. It's unfortunately too cold this week to test this helmet out thoroughly for air flow and features... Coming from the Shoei rf1100, and the rf1200, the HJC 70ST feels cheaper and less refined. Given the starting price is over $100 difference, and the HJC includes a drop down sun visor, I recognize they are in fairly different places in the helmet market. Over all, I do have some complaints. I found most things about the helmet to be fairly good. The weight was better than most competitors (even outside this price point), the helmet comes with a pinlock (though not as nice as some of the higher up brands), and even standing still you can tell the helmet vents better than most. For the price all great things.The interior liner is where I started to feel a little ripped off. I wanted to install my old Sena 10c so I started to pull the helmet apart. The liner actually feels cheaper than most of my previous helmets, and there are multiple areas that look like the engineer simply said \"guess this will do\". Not to mention the chin strap wants to ride back into my throat and it sits on top of some rather poorly designed cheek pads. It isn't the worst liner I have ever seen, but it certainly is not the best.The chin vent is a neat idea, but I find it rather questionable to put the switch inside. Fortunately the switch is rather out of the way and did not interfere with my com system, or effect the general comfort of the helmet. Generally speaking, the vents are all well laid out and can easily be used with gloves (though I do kind of feel like Im going to rip the top vent off like the Hulk). Compared to my Shoei rf1200, this helmet has noticeably better venting even without wind to test it out. And lets be honest, sitting in traffic with a helmet that doesn't breath (especially in the south) will leave anyone questioning if they really even need a helmet.Sun visor seems to work well, though it does leave somethings to be desired. I would like slightly more lens. With the visor fully down, and on top of that, a darker lens. Cable controls are nice, and feel smooth, though often terribly located for a Sena.Lastly, com systems will present some fun challenges. On removing my cheek pads, the sticker that holds the sun visor cable in place detached and pulled out with the pad. Not a problem, but still frustrating. The Sena clamp mount simply was not an option this time around, so a sticky mount worked well. The Sena was installed slightly higher than normal to insure easy sun visor use. Like most newer helmets, the liners have been mortised (for lack of a better word) for speakers. Fingers crossed one day they give us a place to run all the wires! Over all, I think its easy to over expect. This is a good helmet (to my knowledge, since I haven't crashed in it yet). keeping in mind these are only first impressions, I think the helmet will likely prove to be a very worth while helmet for the money. I would not buy this helmet for over $450, but for $360, I think it was money well spent.\n",

      "wI'll make this short and sweet, I have a little over 300 miles on helmet at present and I believe it's starting to break in a little bit. My head measures 23 3/4 inches so I purchased the XL same as my old HJC CS R1. It fits well, all be it the cheak pads are some what snugger than I carer for, no 2X in stock at the moment.  To repeat a reviewers comment that probably sealed the deal for me, quote \" it seals like a submarine hach\". The shield and pin lock are awesome, it didn't fog as I rode last week and it as 45 deg and 97% humidity no cold air leaking in, I am a happy camper. Venting is also good comparatively speaking, I usually wear a half helmet in the summer here in Texas.  I almost forgot to mention the internal visor, it's ok just a little on the light side maybe legal restraints, that or they want to sell folks darker visors, thats ok the shield and pin lock in the box is around a $90 investment if purchased seperately.\n",

      "Okay just picked mine up, first of all it's possibly quieter than my shuberth C3 pro (I wear earplugs in all my helmets as I already have tinnitus and don't want it getting any worse , fit and finish is very very good, I have an intermediate oval head and this fits really well, The dropdown visor is optically in another league to the shuberth , it's like a really good pair of ray bans vs $5 dollar sunglasses, looking through the drop down visor and Main visor with pinlock there is no distortion and I forget I'm looking through anything, It's that good. Venting this is the first helmet I have owned where I can tell if the venting is open or closed, top vent pushes loads of cool air on my head when it's open and instantly stops when it's shut. seriously I always though vents were a bit of a gimmick (until now). Visor seals like an airlock in a submarine, very good mechanism and super tight seal no whistles.Style , well I like it, it doesn't really match my old Guzzi's but I don't care about  period correct everything to match the bike. I appreciate well made gear and wanted a safe quiet helmet with great optics and the splash of yellow at the back doesn't hurt as far as being that bit more visible ( I have the octar model) I was on my Gilera 500 whilst wearing this and vison in full tuck and cranked over is good, it's a sporting / tour ready helmet that I suspect will do well on more upright bikes too but should be totally fine for track days as it's the same tech as the RPHA  11. Ok these were just initial impressions after 100k and nothing over 150kph. Oh and this is the first helmet that I can wear with glasses as there is a slight channel for the arms to slide in easily. Price well I paid more than you will from Revzilla as I am down under and it was available here before it's out in the States , but thought I would add my review here as Revzilla is great.\n",

      "As the title suggests, i do not have much experience with other helmets, but as my first it gets the job done. I bought it for the very aggressive styling which is uncommon for the price point and the build quality is solid. The visor has much to be desired and fogs easily at low speeds, but with the ability to crack open the shield for more ventilation I can forgive them.My biggest gripe is the whistling that occurs at highway speeds. In socal I keep mostly all the vents open and wear earplugs all the time. Going faster than 55mph in a 3/4 to full tuck for me causes all kinds of whistling that is audible even with earplugs. Still, for the price, style, and brand recognition, you cannot go wrong.\n",

      "Bought this helmet a while back, and it's turned out to be a great helmet. Nothing I can really say that's bad about this helmet, except the fact that I didn't like the directions of movement from the vents up top, kinda tricky to open/shut while on the bike, at least for me.Unfortunately, I am able to say that during my crash from yesterday, this helmet did a phenomenal job protecting my head. I hit a mailbox at around 90 miles an hour on a curve, and proceeded into a wooden fence at a slightly lower speed, but still above 75 for sure. Helmet has a scrape to the paint on the top, where my head contacted the fence, but that's the only damage. Very glad to have been wearing AGV at the time :)\n",

      "I don’t have a lot of experience with helmets, that being said I really like this helmet. I ride a sport bike and when I am tucked it has a drone from the airflow over the helmet but if I sit up to where the airflow hits the helmet square on the face shield the noise is considerably lessened.  That also allows the air to flow freely into the air vents. I have not been hot while riding but the temps have only been around 85 at the most.  The fit is nice and super comfortable on my head. Trying to wear my sunglasses is a bit tougher but that may just have to break in and I only wear Oakley’s and their frame isn’t very malleable. Overall I am super stoked with this helmet. It also has three visor adjustments that come with it, which is nice, and they are easy to swap out for different detents for the visor to be put in for different riding styles. Great helmet.\n",

      "The helmet just slices through air with 0 buffeting, and 0 lifting! It’s fairly quiet, and cuts out all wind noise. No whistling noises unless you open the front vent. Very good fog control when the front vent is open. The level of comfort, and fitment feel is that of a much more expensive helmet. Amazing field of vision that lets you easily see around you which is very important in traffic. Its eyeglass friendly, and it has speaker pockets. Dot & Ece rated. Size chart is accurate.  Light weight. Everything feels very solid, and high quality. Its made in china to AGV standards, but designed in Italy.  All in all this is a great helmet for the price, and I completely recommend it if your looking for a helmet under $200!\n",

Most importantly I would've loved this helmet despite no Snell rating. However the whistling made by the visor is just annoying and loud, it ruins the ride. For that reason alone going back to my 420. The bang for your buck it offers blows this AGV out of the water. I understand it's a budget price helmet, but come on a visor should be able to close tight and keep air out.

      "Don't Bump it on Anything\n",
      "I have the black gloss version of this helmet.  The helmet is very light and looks great when it's brand new.  The chin curtain creates a very good seal and makes the helmet very quiet at speed.  It's also very lightweight and doesn't fatigue much during extended periods of riding.However, DO NOT BUMP IT ON ANYTHING!  There is absolutely no enamel or clear coat on this helmet.  I've bumped it lightly on my drywall when putting it on my shelf and lightly bumped against my room door when opening with an arm full of moto gear.  Left immediate scratches into helmet (white gashes).Also be sure to coat the visor or get the pinlock as it will fog up like crazy.  Particularly due to the fact that the chin curtain creates a great seal, but there is no breath guard.I went in with low expectations on this one as I bought it as a daily helmet that I wouldn't mind if I accidentally scratched,.  Sadly, one month in, the K1 looks like my old daily HJC helmet from 2010... sort of... CL-15 is in slightly better condition.\n",

      "This fit true just like My Arai helmets. Compared to the Aria Helmet I have (Vector 2) it has less material around the ears and lets in more air (wind) around the ears but because it has a chin curtain and the Vector 2 does not it lets a lot less air in the front that would make it to the ears and face. I bought this as a good winter helmet and it does well. When summer comes I will compare the Vector 2 to the K1 but I really like the K1 though if it were any tighter around the ears it would be causing pain. Its just barely touching the ears so no issues. Feels very open and less snug at the bottom when on then the Vector 2. And like I said wind noise is better on the K1 from wind coming in the front but it allow more air in around the ears than the Vector 2 so maybe moot point.\n",

It is comfortable, warm, and looks crazy good. Assuming similar qualities to the K3 with the Pista look to it. Couldn't be more pleased with the helmet. Good field of view and pretty light. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap and good looking helmet. Cons:It is a little long in the forehead, you have to use the Sticky adhesive for any Sena device on the smaller shell sizes, and with the chin wind guard on its nearly impossible to open and close the mouth vents. You either have to have 9inch fingers or just deal with your shield fogging or having wind blast you in the face.\n",

This was twice the cost but so much better: Very quiet - I have been able to install my Sena speakers in this helmet and can hear music and phone calls at highway speeds. It is so quiet my callers don’t know I’m on my motorcycle. Solidly built - chin bar closes with a nice clunk and locks smoothly. Ventilation is not as good as the AirohSun Visor action is good. Graphics are great. Looks good It’s light at 1.5kg (for a modular) I’m not sure I could justify upgrading to a Shoei or Schubert as this helmet is such great value and quality for the money.\n",

SO much air flow.- No fog with the included pin lock (as expected)-  Pretty quiet for a modular, We have some full faces that are quieter, but not a modular as quiet as this- The chin bar mechanism is very smooth.- The speaker pockets made for  an easy install for the packtalk boldI will say however, the field of vision is a little smaller than I am used to.For reference, the other helmets we own are:Scorpion 420, 920, and 1200HJC IS MAX IILS2 Valiant Arai Signet Q\n",

      "Before I could really evaluate the fit I noticed that the internal sun visor touches my nose when slid into position, so that's not going to fly. I imagine this to be the case because they make no effort to place the visor's cavity more out from the forehead as Shoei does with the GT-Air and Neotec. Also, the slider to bring it down is in an odd place on the chin and can be hard to find, and it's not as smooth as Sheoi's. Granted, the helmet is about 40% cheaper, but it shows in all the little details. I didn't feel it was worth it at this point to evaluate fit and comfort although I did notice it is really tight when pulling it on and the chin curtain is particularily too large and \"flappy\" so that you have to adjust it every time.

The Neotec developed  hot spots on top of my head. Had a half helmet in the pannier. Ended up wearing it instead of the Neotec. So decided to order the RPHA. It'll work but it's not as nice. The one thing I found most annoying was the top vent. When open it flows air but feels like an air hose is blowing straight down in a 2\" circle on the top of my head. Over all I do think the Neotec 2 is worth the extra cheddar.\n",

It looks great and is very comfortable.Love the integrated sun shield and is easy to use. The vents are easy to find and use. It moves a ton of air across the top of my head. Now here’s the problem I have with the helmetWhat I find most strange and hard to explain is the noise.  It is both quieter and louder than my Icon Airmarda.  I found that the wind sound is greatly reduced than the Icon.  But, the HJC has a terrible thumping sound at highway speeds, anything over 50-60MPH. Sort of like when only one car window is open and it’s almost unbearable.  I was able to reduce the thumping a little by removing the chin curtain but it’s still there at highway speeds. Unfortunately, the only way to learn this is to ride with the helmet which means I now can’t return It. So, I’ll be out $450 if I can’t solve the thumping noise.\n",

      "Purchased the RPHA 90 to replace my Schuberth.  This helmet is much more comfortable than the Schuberth.  It does require a little break in time, but after about 200 miles it feels great.  Just finished a 2,000 mile 6 day ride and it felt nearly perfect.  The visor is large and has great peripheral clearance.  The nose cup can be removed to give a bit more aperture, but I've left it in for now.  The sun visor works great and after only a little time the controls are all easy to use.  I like the sliding sun visor because I can adjust it's position, unlike the spring loaded types.  The top vent can be noisy when open if the wind hits it right, which was a lot.  It's a fairly quiet helmet, at least as quiet as the schuberth.  On the freeway earplugs for sure... off the freeway it's quiet enough without earplugs.  Speaker pockets are a bit shallow, but work with the Sena speakers.  The Sena boom mic was a little difficult to place because it interferes with the speaker placement.  Overall a good helmet for the money, but no helmet seems to be great.\n",

The only slight knock is that the sun visor kinda shimmies down a tad but no biggie.  I rode with this 1800 plus miles and was able to tolerate it pretty easy.  I did take the visor off in 100 degree weather and just wear my sunglasses for more air flow.  the way it disconnects and connects is fabulous. The pin lock works great. I had no fog issues.  Good air flow, but when its hot its just hot...any temp change to cooler weather and you can really tell how much air flow is really moving.  I would highly recommend this lid.

      "Expected More for the Cost\n",
      "Put about 4000 miles on the HJC RPHA 90 helmet last summer during a road trip.  I should have worn it around the house for an hour or two as suggested to determine that it really met my needs. Really expected more for an almost $500 helmet. For $200 more and I could have gotten a Schuberth or Shoei Neotech2 and presumably a better helmet for my requirements.On the positive, it had comfortable fitment, light, nice features of Pinlock and drop down sun shield.  That is where it ends -   I wanted a comfortable helmet with good airflow, quiet and decent integration for an in helmet communication system. Air flow - There is almost no difference between open and closed air vents.  I rode mostly with the visor cracked open to get some ventilation. Even in the cooler weather still have ride with it open.  (my old cheap Z1 $150 full face had better ventilation)  Noise - Claims of a quiet helmet are overstated. One would think that with the lack of airflow, the helmet would be quieter. I always wear some type of ear protection and tried the Pinlock -16db earplugs and wind noise was still too loud. Reverted  back to  foam -32db full plugs as they were the only reasonable option for me to keep the noise fatigue in check.Communication Integration - I tried the highly touted (by FortNine) Cardo Packslim in this helmet. This is essentially the same as the HJC branded comm system.  Not an easy installation (at the time no installation instructions) yet once installed it was a perfect sleek fit with the helmet. Although, I had a issues with the Cardo product with helmet volume (even without earplugs) as it was inconsistent and bluetooth integration was a bit rough.  I returned it without replacement.   Wanted to really like the HJC RPHA 90 helmet yet for the cost it wasn't a value purchase.  Very disappointed. This helmet seems to be mis-represented in the marketing. Interestingly just saw a review on FortaMoto released recently and the reviewer confirmed my impressions of the helmet. So, now appears as though I am going to have to spend premium $$$ to get a helmet with decent airflow, lower noise level and some comm integration.\n",

The noise level is slightly less than my LS2 and the LS2 was a size too big for me. The strap padding isn't as comfortable as my LS2 and it pushes against my neck so I can't put it too tight without discomfort. the sun shield comes down to where it just touches my nose then lifts so I think it is perfect. Vent wise I can't tell if the vents are open or closed, they don't add noise nor do I feel anything on my bald sweaty head. Over all these are my disappointments and all other aspects of the helmet are great.\n",

Also, this thing fogs very easily and the pinlock doesn't help with glasses. Only an issue for me at stoplights when its chilly out, but even with the visor open my glasses fog up.The visor is a little annoying, the lowest open position is too high and the locking mechanism sits right in the middle of your line of sight. I'm not sure what the appeal of a locking visor in a helmet like this is, but its easy enough to open at least.Overall, I like this helmet a lot and am very happy with it overall.\n",

      "I've only had this helmet a few weeks, but I've already ridden 1000+ miles with it. I've got to say, this is an incredible helmet. It ticks all the boxes for me; it's quiet, attractive, comfortable, pin lock visor, and has a drop down visor. I really wish it moved a bit more air through it though, but that would be at the expense of noise. I was worried the visor would be a pain with a gloved hand, but it opens and closes with ease. My biggest complaint is the sun visor. With my winter gloves on it was difficult to find the slider. It was kind of difficult to get it out of the locked position the first couple dozen times, but either I've gotten used to it or it slides from the locked position easier. The helmet is very quiet, especially with the chin curtain in, and I'm definitely not going to complain that it came with a chin curtain and pin lock visor in the box. The button to lift the face of the helmet is easy to find, and it's smooth as silk lifting it until it locks into a detent at the top. This helmet is also incredibly light for the price point and the fact that it's modular. I was torn between the RPHA 90 and the Scorpion AT950, and after trying them both on in a local shop, I'm glad I decided to go with the HJC. I don't think I could buy any better of a helmet without spending double the money, and it would only be better by a little. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.\n",

Easy head checks, no neck ache and decent weather seal (a little water intrusion after 60 miles in a steady rain. I did have one issue with the visor cracking @ the metal latch point around 1 wk into ownership, just in line with the screws clamping the catch.

      "Prior to buying this helmet I only had experienced two other helmets: the Speed & Strength S3000 and a bottom of the line Fly Racing full-face, so I don't have a lot to compare this helmet to. Nonetheless this helmet completely blows both of those helmets away in nearly all aspects. I'll go through each aspect of the helmet that I think is important...Durability: While I've only owned this helmet for a couple weeks, it's clearly well-constructed. The hinges hold well and the visor when lifted actually stays lifted instead of falling back down like other helmets can do. I'll come back and comment on long-term durability later, but it's definitely made of higher quality materials than most other helmets of the price range.Quietness: To me, the second most important element of any helmet is how well it insulates noise. This helmet is amazingly quiet. Incredibly it seems to be nearly as quiet with the front lifted as it is with it and the visor lowered. Clearly the high-quality padding creates a good air seal. Now, it's not dead-quiet, but it is clearly far more quiet than my previous helmet and I can actually hear my Cardos even when riding above 60 mph.Comfort: This helmet uses very soft velvet-like material in its padding and under the chin strap. It feels good being pulled down over my bald head.Features: I love that it came with a free anti-fog visor. At first I didn't realize how to use it. I thought it was a replacement for the built-in sun visor. I rode around for a few extremely humid days and as soon as I dropped the visor it would fog up immensely. I was very disappointed in the helmet because of this. Then I was fooling around with the visor, popped out the sun visor and went to install the anti-fog visor when I realized it actually pops onto the back of the external visor. Since then I haven't had a single issue with fogging. Wunderbar! I like the retractable built-in sun visor, however, it takes some getting used to finding the switch, especially with my Cardos communication system installed (it's kinda in the way of it, caused me to have to install it using the sticky pad and further up than I'd prefer) The switch is also a bit tough to get moving but I became accustomed to it. The chin strap can be a bit tricky to attach one-handed. That's probably my only remaining con once I solved the fogging issue.Air-flow: Air flow on this helmet is tricky. The top vent works amazingly well. My babyback scalp definitely feels the air flow as soon as that vent is opened up. The bottom doesn't vent all that well, but it's sufficient at high speeds with the top vent open.\n",

Rpha 90 is definitely a snugger fit all the way around which I was happy to see however the ear area needed modifications to alleviate pressure points in the upper ears and I'm unable to use the sound proofing pads or install speakers with out creating further pressure points issues,,.Its definitely compact, light and relatively comfortable and I still plan to get many years of service out of the it,,.\n",

      "Chose this over the Shoei Neotec and Schuberth C3 Pro, and glad I did. VERY quiet for a modular, and very light as well. In a medium size, it was over half a lb lighter than my spare Bell Revolver Evo. Ventilation is superb, and easy to modulate. My only gripe so far is that the drop down visor controls are incredibly difficult to work. It seems to get quite stuck, and requires a LARGE amount of force to open. Once it \"clicks\", it slides freely and smoothly. Very strange...aside from that, this is probably the best helmet I've ever owned.Couple side notes: I took the velcro wind blocker off the inner chin area. In the warm weather, it blocks the air so effectively that it gets rather stuffy. I imagine it will be awesome in the winter at stopping cold updrafts. Also, the modular portion of the helmet locks rather strongly into the \"up\" position, and very high up. Nice feature, as previous modulars I've owned had the top portion move or try and come down of their own accord.\n",

      "I’ve ridden about 200 Miles in this helmet so far. It’s louder than my Shoei RF 1000 but noise is definitely manageable. Fit and finish are great. And RevZilla was great! Had to return my first one because it was too small. Return process was simple and they refunded my money really quick. And got the next size larger helmet to me in less than a week from sending the first one back. Great job\n",

      "Well, for $430 I'd like my helmet to be watertight.  But, on my first full day I rode through a rainstorm and more than a couple of drops fell on my head.  Not criminal, but I expected more for the price.  the lid was heavier than I expected.  It seems about the same weight as my HJC CJ 17, even though it is rated 500g lighter.   On the plus side:  I like the sun visor and the modular function, and the materials seem top notch.  Overall, I'm not sure it's t 2.5X 'better' than my cheaper HJC.\n",

      "A relative who sold bikes for a living recommended HJC as it was a great helmet without breaking the bank.  Couldn't agree more.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and the quality of this product.  This helmet came with an anti-fog lens piece and I wasn't expecting that.  Great!I own two HJC helmets and I find the dollar value very very high with this company.  As a mostly weekend rider and occasional weekday, I wanted a helmet with great features, quality build, and did not break the bank.   I would purchase this helmet again for the price and the features.  If you are a daily rider, your needs may be a bit higher and your budget should be as well.  I have no complaints about this helmet.  I look forward to many rides.  Last, I get compliments every time I ride about my bike, and after that,... the helmet.  Great work HJC.  Awesome pricing Revzilla (and thanks for shipping it early!).\n",

      "I really wanted to like this helmet, but...\n",
      "I've been searching for a modular helmet for several months.  I tried the Schuberth C3 and C4, Shoei Neotec, Shark Evoline, and AGV Sport Modular helmets in the Revzilla show room, but didn't really like any of them.  I took  the chance on the HJC Rpha 90 and ordered it knowing that I could return it as long as I didn't wear it outside or remove any of the labels.  At initial inspection, the quality seemed to be very good.  The fit is spot on (no pressure points) and helmet is very light.  The only issue I have with it is with the drop down sun visor.  Though it drops down far and offers great coverage, it doesn't lock into place when fully retracted and falls 1/4\" to 1/2\" from where it should rest inside the helmet, and it also bounces up and down since it doesn't lock into place.  Seeing the sun visor bounce up and down in the periphery would be annoying when riding.  As a result, I am returning this helmet and may reorder it in the future hoping that the quality assurance process will improve.\n",

      "Stellar lightweight, premium modular!\n",
      "I just received the RPHA 90 after eagerly awaiting its release.  Suffice to say it does not disappoint.  I believe it should win “best value” for a premium, lightweight, and quiet modular.It fits my intermediate oval head nicely, has hands down the best open/close mechanism I’ve used, which can easily be operated with a thick glove, and is definitely comfortable.  The “P.I.M. fibre composite mix” used for the shell seems to have accomplished the intended purpose in terms of reducing weight, and I much appreciate the benefits of having 3 outer shell sizes (I’m M).  I’ve only ridden to and from work so this review is admittedly limited, but I can share that it is 100% much quieter than the Nolan N104 it replaced, as well as my former and unbearably loud Kabuto Ibuki, and the shell is definitely smaller than my N104.  Fabrics are soft, plush, and comfortable.  It’s seems best in class for a quiet premium modular helmet that is sub $500, and at least based on my online research can compete with Neotech and some more expensive premium helmets.  Some additional notes:All mechanisms operate smoothly with exception of the sun visor, which at least on the helmet I received is stiff at the initial pull.Field of range is “shorter” than average (width is fine), but I’m happy with the safety advantage.One of the smoothest visor removal latches I’ve used - I was able to get the visor off and pin lock on in a breeze.Some extra space at the ears seemed to make my AirPods come a little loose, but I think I fixed the issue with some ear pad inserts that came with it.  It also comes with a thicker chin curtain for colder weather that is a nice touch.Gloss black looks sleek and the design features complement my T-100 and LXV 190 very nicely.  I added a thick strip of Solas reflective tape to the back to increase visibility since I went black (uncharacteristically), and it actually looks quite great.I prefer ratchet mechanisms over the D-rings that come with the RPHA 90, but I’ll deal with it and decided it’s an ok trade off.Not yet sure about air leakage and warmth.  I ride 4 seasons here in DC and have found some modulars ride a little cold.  If it’s clear this will be an issue I’ll try to update this review, but as far as I could tell from a short ride at 40ish degrees I was fine, especially with the thicker chin curtain, and the quietness makes me think it’ll be ok.  No comment yet on quality of air flow.Bottom line is this helmet appears to be a significant improvement over the other “mid-level” and “entry level” helmets I’ve had,  e.g. the N104, Ibuki, Nolan N43E, a Scorpion EXO that I despised, a cheap Z1R that I actually loved and got many miles out of, etc.  I hope this review helps the Revzilla community.  Ride safe!\n",

      "1 Feature makes this the best lid on the market\n",
      "Maybe not for everyone individually, but overall this is the best lid available- for 1 reason... the fit system.What about the sinister shell shape? The vented cheek pads? The awesome chin bar deflector? The light-ish weight? The available transitions visor? The stabilizing fins on the rear (which noticeably work)? Etc. Etc. Etc.Yes, all of those things are awesome, top-of-the-line features as well. But, it is the interchangeable liner pieces that make this helmet supreme.Comfort, noise, stability, and most importantly safety all greatly depend on how closely a helmet actually fits your noodle. There are indeed many different profile and size configurations out there from the dozens of different manufacturers, and undoubtedly some of them may fit select folks' heads very accurately-but anyone who has ridden awhile knows that a truly perfect fit is generally out of the question for the bulk of riders out there. Sometimes we have to deal with some forehead discomfort, maybe we have to opt for a shell size that is huge and fit it with large cheek  pads to get a near fit, there's always some defect we have to accept... not anymore.The system shoei made for the x-14, with 3 different sizes not just for the top part of the liner but the front, rear, sides, and cheek pads too, is a complete game changer. For my long oval dome, a size Large, with the thicker top pad, normal front pad, thinner rear pad, and thicker side pads is such a perfect fit that while being the most snug, secure fitting helmet I have ever had (zero buffeting and very low noise accordingly), it is also the most comfortable and when I take it off after a 2 hours ride I have zero- ZERO- red marks on my face. Zero, zilch, nada. I tell you, I didn't even think that was possible after a shelf full of helmets that fit pretty well.Got a round dome? Try the thin sides with the thick front and back. Somewhere in between? Mix and match until you get the perfect fit.Most quality helmets have 3 shell sizes and 3 cheek pad sizes. That's 9 configurations. The X-14 has 648 configurations if you do the math. If I was a betting man, I would say you're a bit more likely to find a perfect match with 648 chances than 9.Give it a try. Order the different sized pads with the helmet and see if you can find a fit like you've never had before. In my opinion, regardless of the helmet's intended purpose- an absolute perfect fit trumps all other factors. My X-14 is more stable, quiet, and comfortable than any other helmet on not just my FZ-10, but my Harley as well. That's just about every riding position covered except a true tuck- which is the X-14's actual purpose!I'd say give it a shot if you've never had a truly perfect fitting helmet. Order all the different sized pads with the helmet and see what you can find. It might just be the revelation for you it is for me.\n",

      "I don't normally write reviews for products ive purchased(I probably should, doesn't hurt and I always find other reviews incredibly helpful lol) but this helmet really is my favorite so far.I have a spending problems when it comes to helmets, I've got an Arai Corsair X, a Pista GP R and now a Shoei x14. So far, the x14 is by far my favorite. I just went out on the parkway in 35 mph winds and this thing absolutely sliced through everything, didn't feel anything on my head. I love the visor, has a nice feeling mechanism, very easy to take off, and the pinlock works wonderfully. The helmet has speaker cut outs but I wear earbuds connected to my Sena 20S(which this helmet takes very well) so I leave the ear pieces in and it actually has a nice secure feeling on my ears. This helmet has easily taken the place of my AGV and Arai at this point, it just feels right and it's still extremely aggressive looking(one thing I didn't like about the corsair x).\n",

      "Like a hot knife through butter\n",
      "I purchased this helmet from a motorcycle dealership but I figure that my review will be better used on Revzilla.I walked into a motorcycle dealership intent on purchasing an Icon or a Bell Star in the $400-500 range. After trying on a slew or helmets getting the fit right the x-14 caught my eye. The salesman being a salesman encouraged me to try it on and instantly I knew in my gut I was going to buy it. it was out of my price range but hell if it wasn't the most comfortable helmet I tried on. in the end the salesman was able to drop the price near $200 (after tax) and get it closer to my range where I couldn't pass it up.At first I was worried about the helmet being wasted on me since I haven't been to a track yet but boy was I wrong. I think that the features make it great for street riding and I'm incredibly happy with my purchase.In addition to being comfortable the shape of the helmet cuts through the air like...a hot knife through butter....which is perfect when I don't have fairings to do that for me. The ventilation is fantastic and long rides in the 98 degree weather was no problem. It is incredibly quiet enough that I can wear an ear bud and listen to directions without needing to turn up the volume when I'm at speed. Conclusion:This is a fantastic helmet and probably will be the best helmet I ever own. I was worried the features would be lost on me since I do not go to the track but I was completely wrong. If you can justify the price (or negotiate at the dealership) then this will be perfect street helmet that looks good and preforms even better. 15/10 would buy again\n",

      "Great as a Touring / Street Helmet Too!\n",
      "I have an oddly shaped head: It is \"ice cream cone\" shaped, which means that it's almost perfectly round at the top, but narrow and long in the face. Most of the helmets out there  fit well on top of my head, and leave massive amounts of room around my face, or fit my face well, and be far too tight up top. Obviously, that makes fitting a helmet very difficult. In addition, I have pretty serious neck issues which make weight, field of view (I have limited mobility to head check), ease of movement important. I also largely ride touring. I do not go to the track or race at all. I tried on the Schuberth C3, Neotec, Bell Star and Race Star, Arai Quantum, and the fit was not appropriate in any of them. Then I tried the X-14, which I did not expect to like, as most of my riding is touring and it is a racing helmet. However, I fell in love with this helmet the first time I rode with it. I am fortunate to have an environment where I have access to an industrial room with giant, industrial fans. Therefore, I can literally sit in front of several giant fans with the helmet on and listen to the wind and feel the ventilation without having to ride in the helmet. I look a bit weird doing it, but it provides a great test of noise and vents.First off, it fits my oddly shaped head better than any other helmet I've ever worn. My head measures between 54.75 cm and 55.25 cm depending on exactly how you measure it, which de facto makes me a 55cm. In the past I have owned Shark, HJC, Scorpion, and always had to go to sizes larger than were appropriate in order to fit my head, which left too much room in the face. I was wearing either Mediums or Larges. I am now, finally, in a proper size small and it feels perfect. Benefits of the helmet:1. Super aerodynamic. Cuts through the air, no buffeting on head checks. Even at highway speed, I do not feel any \"pull\" even during very windy days and high speeds. 2. Field of view is massive. Largest field of view of any helmet I've ever worn. Slightly smaller field of view than Bell Race Star, but larger than anything else out there. 3. Perfectly balanced. Technically, it is a bit heavier than most of the other helmets that it competes with, but because of the balance, you just don't feel it. I am particularly sensitive to weight, as I have neck issues, and this helmet is by far the \"lightest\" that I've ever worn. In additon, the shell size is compact, and does not look like a \"bobble head\" as so many helmets do. 4. Ventilation is excellent. Not as good as Arai Quantum, but still excellent. Having 4 vents works beautifully. Most of my riding is \"straight up\". As this is a race helmet, I was concerned that it would only vent well in the tuck position, but for straight up riding, even in fully erect posture, it vents beautifully. If you go into a tuck, you do move a lot more air, but it's unnecessary to seek that position for ventilation purposes. 5. Surprisingly quiet. It is not a Schuberth C3, but it is just as quiet as an Arai Quantum, and quieter than any other helmet I have worn. Chin vent is very quiet, and wheek and brow vents are almost totally silent when open. Top vent increases noise substantially, but even with all vents open it is still \"earplugs optional\" for me at least. With all vents closed, I can hear the muffled hum of my motor, but almost nothing else. 6. Transition lens is the best decision I have made in a long time, and the fact that they have a photochromic lens for this helmet is a huge plus. Additionally, the shield change mechanism is one of the fastest and easiest that I've ever seen. However, with the transitions lens, I don't use it ! City defogging feature works great. shield lock is excellent. 7. The sweeping cut of the helmet down by the shoulders means that the helmet does not hit your shoulder or catch on my jacket when I turn my head. Other helmets would bump my shoulder or catch on the jacket during head turns, making movement awkward. This helmet has solved that problem, making head checking easy and efforless (which is a huge plus with my limited mobility). 8. Interior is VERY soft and plush and extremely comfortable. 9. So far I have ridden with the helmet ibetween 28 degree F conditions and 85 degree F conditions. On the cold day, there was some fogging (no pinlock installed yet), but it was easily managable by keeping the chin vent and brow vent halfway open when moving and then cracking to city defog position at stops.All in all, even thought this helmet is a \"racing\" helmet, if you are looking for a solid touring / street helmet with all of the amenities, you should give this helmet a serious look. I cannot recommend it enough.\n",

      "This is my second Shoei I've owned, my previous shoei was actually my first helmet back in 2003, an RF 1000.  I found that helmet in a size medium was very snug on the check pads but broke in with time.  But im currently riding with AGV 1st gen Pista.  The AGV has been my main helmet but I was looking for something with a similar race profile, weight, vision but that could also incorporate a sena 10c.  The AGV Pista does not have ear cut outs and the other two helmets I was wanting to try (Bell Race Star and AGV Corsa R) don't have cut outs either.  The X14 though seemed to have it all so I decided to give it a shot.  First the good things: I was originally a bit concerned with the weight being a middle range and heavier than most race helmets, but surprisingly it doesn't feel all that heavy when I wear it.  It even feels pretty comparable when wearing it to the Pista even though I know it's a lot heavier- so good work on the balancing of weight shoei. I can tell the added weight easily comes from its internals, which are way more beefy on this helmet over the Pista.   Vision is also good on the helmet and the visor notches are a nice added feature from the Pista.  It also flows a ton of air, and it's nice to have switches again to turn them off on over the Pista's nearly impossible to use rubber plugs.  The padding is also fairly substantial and I like the snaps for the cheek pads.  The snaps for the Pista are HORRIBLE and the inner snaps have broke on me twice.  Now for the bad, I read from others that the cut outs for the ear speakers are smaller than the sena speakers.  I can confirm this.  The sena speakers are larger in diameter than the cutouts by just a smile smudge. Please fix this shoei, Senas are one of if not the most popular Bluetooth sets out there, your speaker cutouts should be large enough to fit them!  I still made it work by fitting the Velcro to the rear which so far appears to hold them in, but I am concerned they won't stay that way.  The other thing I've noticed is the rear of the helmet doesn't angle upward as much as the Pista.  This has led to some discomfort when I take the helmet off.  I usually don't completely undo my chin strap and instead widen it out and move it forward off my chin then pull the helmet back.  But since this comes down further it digs in fairly hard on the back of my neck, where as my Pista does not do this.  Also the material on the Pista's necklace liner is much softer and less corse compared to the stiff material on the shoei.  I think the shoei provides a ton of impact protection and the cheek pads on this helmet provide a fair amount of pressure, but they can work on making the materials a bit softer.  Overall a really nice helmet and a great amount of technology in this.  I'm going to enjoy using it this summer!\n",

      "I expected the X14 to be louder than it is.  It's much quieter than I thought it would be. I am extremely pleased with the X14. It's a great helmet.  VERY tight fit which is something I like. It takes significant effort to don  this helmet but... the harder it is to get on, the harder it will be to come off. This lid will not come off in a crash! I have 100% confidence in that. Even though the helmet fits extremely tight, it is quite comfortable once it's on.  I have always had a hard time finding helmets that fit and perform. The Shoei X14 fits me amazingly well and it disappears. Once you get used to the tight cheek pads, you hardly know you have a helmet on. I wear an XS helmet. Most XS from other brands are too big for me. With the X14, I could go a size up and be fine but like I said, I want the absolute smallest, tightest fitting helmet I can squeeze my head into.There are no hot spots. There are no pockets of extra room inside the helmet. It's like it was custom molded for my head. There is no wiggle room anywhere inside the helmet. Its form fitting front to back, top to bottom and side to side. It's a perfect fit (for me).Wind can't see this helmet. No buffeting at all. I was amazed. I hit 160mph and it felt like I was only going 40mph. Head checks were just about as good. The X14 FAR exceeds other helmets in this category. Ventilation is great. You can actually feel air from each individual vent. You don't have to break the sound barrier to get good air flow. The cheek vents actually work! It's not mind blowing air but you do feel the air at the cheeks. No other helmet dose this. The visor is thick, flat and substantial feeling. The provided pinlock is a must have. Tear off posts are on the visor. I can't speak to the vortex generators (turbulaters) because I have no idea if they help or not. I would imagine they do. I would rather have have them than not. I'm trusting Shoei that they actually do something. The chin spoiler works great! Diverts the wind so it does not feel like it's hitting the front of the helmet. It also Diverts wind from blasting in under the helmet. Think AGV hawks Bill but without the very loooooong chinguard.There are 2 things that could be improved with the X14. Both might make no difference to hardcore racers but it would make a difference to me.The speaker pockets are too small. You can squeeze Sena 20S speakers in there but it's not a great fit. The speaker pockets could be just a little deeper and larger.The chin curtain scrapes your face when you put on our take off the helmet. Because this helmet has such a tight fit, the chin curtain was scrapping my cheekbones. It was painful! I'm trying to find a way to have the chin curtain installed and not rub the skin off my face. I own and/or have owned the Shoei RF1200, the Scorpion EXO R 2000, the HJC RPHA 11 and the Scorpion EXO (I think) 700.The Shoei X14 is BY FAR the best of them all.\n",

      "Best helmet I've ever owned\n",
      "I needed a new helmet and decided to buy the best protection, fit and airflow for me.  This helmet fit the bill.  The fit is ovalish and there are a wealth of internal adjustments to get the 'just right' feel. The airflow is extremely controllable through the multiple vent intakes. The helmet is on the light side and does not cause me neck fatigue.  The visor articulation is easy and positive in the adjustment points. Pinlock does work well.  Great helmet and I'd recommend it to be on the list of helmets to look at if you're in the market for a new one.  The only drawback is that it is on the higher side of helmet prices.\n",

Everything happen for a reason.Conform is definitely here and the customization is incredible!-It is a little loud but nothing terrible, I mean no helmet will be perfectly hermetic to noise.-The optically correct shield is awesome and offer a wide vision-It is very light-The look of it is amazing, way sportier than the previous x12I have a Sena s10 mounted on and a go pro on the chine and no problem on that matter!Shoei deliver again!

      "Had an X-12 for 5 years before upgrading to the X-14. The adjustable foam positions and new shield locking system are awesome features. I didn't really like the X-12's shield locking feature. I am the same size in an X-14 as I was in an X-12 though it feels like a slightly more snug entry into the helmet. I know the X-14 does its job after highsiding at the track the second time I wore it. I am now on my second X-14.\n",

      "Massive Upgrade from a Shoei Qwest\n",
      "The first helmet I purchased was a Shoei Qwest and after logging a few years in that it was time to upgrade. I was torn between an Arai and another Shoei, but with the X-14 coming I decided to wait and give that a shot. Compared to a Qwest, the fit is a lot snugger, and even after the pads have broken in over the last months of riding it remains noticeably snugger. The shield lock springs and action all feel more substantial than the Qwest. Ventilation is also noticeably improved over the Qwest and on hot days I can feel the air channels moving air through the helmet where I couldn't really on the Qwest.The largest upgrade compared to the Qwest was the aerodynamic stability: at higher speeds the X-14 tracks so much better along with the bike compared to the Qwest which was always slightly buffeting in the wind. Noticed it on the very first ride and it has been great ever sinceThe fit and finish have been typical Shoei quality and in 4 months nothing has gone wrong. I look forward to more great miles with this helmet and would recommend it to anyone looking for an upgrade over their current helmet. Perhaps the only downside is that the increased number of airflow vents means there are more tight places for bugs to splat and require a bit of extra cleaning... But that's a small price to pay for the numerous other benefits the X-14 has.\n",

      "Bought this because I was looking for a quiet helmet that would not wobble on my head at speed. While not as quiet as I would like, it is pretty decent. Excellent fit and finish. Except. . . The mechanism for holding the liner at the front if the helmet does not work. My liner keeps coming undone where the liner meets the front, mainly because there is nothing to hold the tabs that attach the liner when you slide them in. See pictures. Great helmet marred by one glaring defect. I'll upgrade my review if Shoei fixes the problem, otherwise it is back to Arai.\n",

      "Just a quick review, this was actually the last helmet I thought I'd buy. I was originally looking at the AGV Pista GP and the Arai Corsair X. The AGV has the looks, fits great, and is very light. It lacks some of the niceties, however, like speaker cut outs. It is also the most expensive. The Arai had all the niceties, but didn't have that awesome aggressive look I was after and didn't fit my head as well. A Revzilla geek recommended I look at the new X-14. Glad I did! Not only does have the best of both worlds, but it is also the least expensive... Who would have thought? Fits great, cuts through the wind, takes a Sena unit without issue, and looks amazing.

      "1st month of owning my X-14 and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I've been using 2 HJC RPHA-10s in particular for the past 3 years for street and track use (I rotate between the two helmets). My dream helmet has been the AGV Corsa for a while now and I finally had the opportunity to purchase one at MotoGP in Austin this year. Aside from doing my research and reading endless rider reviews, I also had the opportunity to try on the new Arai Corair-X, the new Bell Race Star, and Shark Race-R Pro. The Shoei surprisingly beat all of them out in the end (I've never been a big Shoei fan). It's light, ventilates superbly, visibility is excellent sitting upright and in full tuck, it cost the same as the X-12, and it fit my head the best out of all the candidates. I'm so excited to turn my first laps at the track with this helmet!\n",

      "try it on outside on a sunny day BEFORE buying\n",
      "I've owned many helmets over the years, but never a Shoei. I was in the market for a new track helmet, so I decided to try their flagship offering, based on all the rave reviews. In a word, I'd have to describe X-14 as disappointing. Maybe my expectations were too high? I don't think so...I feel that consumers should expect the best from a helmet that is in the $600-800 range. First impressions when you first slide the helmet on are actually quite good. Fit is excellent, as is the finish of the paint, typical high quality Shoei. The first time I took it out on the road, it was cloudy out, and I was able to confirm what all the reviews had talked about. Minimal lift, fairly quiet,(quietness doesn't really matter to me, I always wear earplugs), stable at highspeed, while on head at speed, it feels lighter than it actually is(@ 3lbs 9.5 oz for a size Medium, I wouldn’t call this helmet a featherwieght). The visibility through the eyeport is good (on par with the RF-1200). After my first ride, initial impressions were good, and I was quite pleased with the helmet. Then I rode it on a sunny day. With the sun overhead, or when riding towards the sun, there is a glare that comes from the top of the visor that is blinding. I switched out the clear visor to the dark tint CWR-1 that I purchased. Same blinding glare. I tried to ignore it, and rode for 15minutes, trying to hold my head to the side, or with my neck flexed to keep from being blinded, but that’s no way to ride. Check the circled area in my pics, to get an idea of where the glare is coming from. I guess the take away message is to try the helmet on if you can, and walk outside on a sunny day and move your head up/down and left/right while facing the sun to ensure that you don’t have the same problem I did. Helmet was sent back to Shoei for inspection. In the meantime I’m riding with my friend’s RF-1200. Honestly, the RF-1200 is every bit as good, if not better, while also being lighter,(3lbs 5.7oz in a size Medium), yet it is half the price of the X-14. I have a hard time recommending the X-14 when Shoei makes such a good helmet in the RF-1200, kicking myself for not having bought that one instead.\n",

      "Wow bought it thinking ok its just an upgrade! But it ended up being soo much more. First off you get what you pay for, worth the every penny, I got a Medium since normally Shoei's mediums fit amazing on my head.1. Went home, tore it apart to install the my S20. You can sit the S20 in between really deep and tighten it so you know it's no going anywhere, unlike my 1200, the little angle that it makes and the padding make it hard for the clip to flush. Not with this helmet though. Put it back together really quick and everything is nice and hidden regardless of the microphone you use.2. Put the spoiler in the front and the breath guard, took 10 seconds.3. Took it out for a spin, I was on residential roads at first and tried to move my head looking around to see if any drag would occur or if wind will catch and pull me back; nothing, it was like a knife through \"hot\" butter.4. Forgot to open all the vents, once opened i jumped on the highway and really put it into use, it was amazing just cutting through the air. The airflow was great no issues at all. The helmet was really silent, music sounded really clear.5. Got home, could not wait for the next day to come.100/100Next purchase the ( Asail ) graphic one.Recommended accessory : CWR-1 Transitions shield. Another great addition to this beast.\n",

      "The large helmet I tried on fit perfectly. But I ended up taking the advice I was given, and purchased a medium helmet size. At first it was a lot more snug than I thought would be able to deal with. But just like they said, the pads wore in after a few rides and now it fits me perfectly.It is extremely comfortable. The noise level, with all vents open, at highway speeds is exceptional.The airflow keeps my face perfectly cool, even in the miserable Central Texas weather.It came with a pin-lock, and the face shield release makes it ridiculously easy to swap out shields.Cosmetically, this is the sexiest helmet I have ever seen, and it even came with an awesome bag.My only gripe (not really a gripe), is that it was a PITA for me to get the anti-fog insert in, but I realize it is so it doesn't just fall out.I'd definitely buy it again.\n",

The fit is perfect for my head, the air flow is insane, and it's super stable at high speeds. It also looks freaking BA. The noise on the helmet is weird though. It's a loud helmet, but I don't really hear any wind noises comprared to my previous helmets (HJC SyMax 3, Bell RS-1, Shoei RF1200). This helmet may be overkill for street riding, but after my crash I wanted to make sure I was wearing the best helmet I could. I figure if this thing is good enough for Marc Marquez then it's good enough for me.\n",

      "The best investment for my motorcycle Ive bought!\n",
      "1) Balance while at riding at all speeds.2) Optical clarity with the visor with the pinlock shield (which is provided with the helmet)3) Buffeting = non existent, Aerodynamics feel on point! my head stays so still when getting up to speed when compared to my old helmet that I dont even realize how fast sometimes I am actually going.4) Venting is definitely way way better. With the cheek venting system, you can actually feel the slight cooling sensation in the cheek pads. The top chimney vent wide open (in my opinion) had a lot of venting in the mohawk of the head. While waiting for some friends I kept my helmet on to build up some sweat, and once I started riding I instantly started to feel cooler.5) Noise reduction - It padding does make a good seal around the head, and when paired with the chin curtain it does make it pretty quiet. 6) I can actually head check! - (this one is probably more for me but yeah) with my old helment I do notice when I try to to head checks, the outer shell would bump into my shoulder because the helmet was fairly large so I wouldnt be able to turn my head all the way. The X-14 is a different story, the shell its self is smaller but you still feel protected but the shell does not bump into my shoulder so I can head check better.7) It looks AMAZING - when paired with the smoke visor it looks even better in person.\n",

      "Definitely not a Neotec, but that's not a bad thing\n",
      "First, I will preface this review by saying I bought this helmet not from Revzilla, but at a huge discount from a different distributor. Having last owned a first-generation Shoei Neotec for about 5 years and 50k miles, I was in the market for a replacement. I tried on the Neotec 2 and was impressed with it, but the built-in SRL requirement was a dealbreaker as I already had a Sena 20s and did not want to spend an additional $300 for the same functionality. Listening to the awesome reviews here, I went ahead and ordered the AGV SportModular for roughly 1/2 MSRP. First impressions: This helmet is light. So light, in fact, that it almost feels cheap (unimpressive plastic trim doesn't help). With the traditional line of modulars, weight gives the impression that helmets are solid and well built. Good thing the 3k Carbon Fiber is exposed or you could easily believe this helmet is all plastic from the weight. To that end, the carbon fiber shell is beautifully well made, the hinge mechanism is unbelievably thin, and the chin bar has a very positive latch when closed. The visor, while the lack of positions is a bit disappointing, does offer an extremely wide view. The sunshade is a bit lighter in tint than the Neotec, but offers similar functionality. The vents feel as everyone says, but they do function well.The fit: I came from a comfortable fit in a Shoei Medium to a comfortable fit in the SportModular Medium. The pad placement is a bit different, however. The AGV pads end farther back on your face, leaving you without the chupmunk-face I got from the Neotec. Combined with the lack of weight, I feel less overall pressure on my head in the AGV. I also noticed initially that the rear of the comfort liner would pull out every time I removed the helmet, but I later found that the two rear tabs had not been locked in. After correctly inserting them, the helmet functioned fine. As noted, the top pad is reversible for different weather, but as it touches my hair and not my skin I can't imagine that will make any real difference. I was disappointed that the side/ neckroll was not reversible. Riding impressions: I will note that I ride a Multistrada with a windshield, so my helmets are not exposed to undisturbed wind. That said, a jet of air typically hits the top of my helmet and top vent. Compared to the first-gen Neotec, this AGV is LOUD. Obviously, AGV was focused on making a lightweight helmet, foregoing some of the sound-deadening material found in other helmets. When riding without wind-protection, I would rate the noise level as quite good. There is not a lot of turbulence created by the helmet and it is a good bit quieter than it is behind my windshield. Vents open/ closed do not alter the noise level as much as my Neotec. Other than the noise, I did notice a small level of distortion around the bottom edge of the sunshield that is a minor irritant. the locking visor is easily released with one hand, but the locking mechanism never goes out of sight, even with the visor all the way up. To that end, the chin-bar also remains in view even when raised. As previously mentioned, the chin-bar is easy to use with a solid feel, I would argue better than the original Neotec. TL:DR- This is a good helmet, for the $5-600 range. The shell and functional bits are well made and very premium feeling, but the plastics and noise level really keep the whole package from feeling like a $700+ helmet should feel (in my opinion). If you can find one like I did for a decent discount, I'd say go for it. If you already have a bluetooth communicator, I'd recommend this helmet. If you are new to the helmet game of planning on purchasing a new communicator anyway, the Neotec 2 may be a better answer.\n",

Shoei helmets hurt my head, Schubert C3 fits but a very painful ride, I get a neck ache instantly. Having done two eek trip on my Schubert I appreciate this helmet being so lightweight. I went for a second ride in it, it vents really good and I am getting used to the controls. I love how the sun wiser is so light from the inside when I have it on, but dark outside and  really protects me from the sun.Installing Sena was seamless, and even with the vents on I can hear my music.

      "Still in the Honeymoon phase with mine. It’s my first modular, and needs to be broken in, so I’m not going to complain about it being tight. Simply put, this is the most beautiful helmet I’ve purchased. I also got the extra shield with it (gold), and it looks absolutely sick with the black. Still need to figure out how to keep earbuds/earplugs in because its pretty damn tight. I’ll update after my trip west.Chin strap complaints can be fixed with not cinching it so tight. The drop down visor does hit my nose, but is not a deal breaker. Overall, it is definitely worth getting, Lightest helmet I’ve ever owned, and it makes a difference. One note on sizing: Use a tape to measure your dome. I was at 58, so in between medium and large. Definitely go up if in doubt or close.\n",

      "Best Modular Bucket Yet?\n",
      "After reading some of the negative reviews about the fit, noise, face shield, and overall build, I’m glad I went ahead and purchased this helmet.  I’d like to go ahead and address these items from my experience and hopefully it will provide a thorough review.Fit – I followed the fitment guide exactly and found it to be quite accurate.  My measurement is 56.5 cm. I followed the instructions and went with the next size up.  The initial fit was snug, but fit perfectly around my forehead, ears and back of my head.  The cheek pads were tight but after a few days of riding have molded to my face shape and are snug and comfortable.  I am an intermediate oval head shape, so this bucket was built for skulls like mine.Noise – I ride with earplugs anyway so I really wasn’t concerned about noise but wow.  I could barely hear the pipes on my Harley.  I tested it without earplugs.  The road and wind noise were still at a low enough level where my ears did not ring after 80 miles at 65+ mph.  The more vents that are open the more noise of course. If you’re looking for a quiet ride, go for the earplugs.Face Shield – I’ve read negative comments about the locking mechanism, how difficult it is to open, how the lock on the bottom of the face shield is like a targeting reticle if you ride with the shield open and so on.  Here are some facts you should be aware of.  To open the shield simply push your thumb into the button and then lift.  The shield will come right open.  No need for two hands, multiple fingers, etc. One can literally open this thing with mittens on.  The locking mechanism at the bottom of the shield does not sit in my field of vision with the visor completely open.  If I put it half way down, it’s there but who would do that?  The reality is the shield lock is held on by a small Phillips head screw.  Remove this and you’ll have no lock, no reticle.Neck roll – the neck roll and padding are phenomenal.  I’ve tested it in 2 thunderstorms so far and my face has remained dry with no moisture blowing up from my chest.  After installing my Bluetooth, I found where the neckroll looked like it was coming out.  I pulled the rubber liner back from the rim and saw the clip was undone.  I clipped it back and have had no further issues.Bluetooth install – this was the third helmet I’ve installed a Bluetooth setup on and by far the simplest.  The covers for the speaker holes were held on by two clips that were easy to remove.  The speaker holes have the back side for Velcro attachment, and it was just place and press.  I mounted a boom mike through the cheek pad and it’s been phenomenal.  Took about 15 minutes from start to finish.To wrap up, I’m glad I tested this helmet out for myself.  I could have missed out on a phenomenal bucket.  I’d recommend anyone interested in it to do the same.  Follow the fitment chart, know what is acceptable for your noise rating, practice the face shield lock a couple times with a gloved finger or just remove it all together, and if this isn’t for you go with something that is.  Spending $750 on a helmet, you should be happy to put it on your noggin.  We’ll be taking a 2500-mile tour next week and if anything changes, I’ll update my review.\n",

      "This helmet is vastly overpriced for what it is. It feels like a helmet worth half of its MSRP if that. To begin with, yes the helmet is very light but that’s because there is nothing to it, there is very little inside of it. The helmet is very loud even with all of the vents closed it leaks a lot of air and especially into the face. Even with the face shield and chin vent closed my face was freezing and it still fogged up even with the Pinlock inserted. The one-piece neckroll is very annoying because the bottom keeps wanting to pop out and it doesn’t look like it will tuck in properly. The face shield lock is unnecessary and difficult to open with one gloved hand. The chinstrap doesn’t dig into my neck like reviews have said but the strap itself feels cheap. The face shield does have a wide field of view but when I have to open it slightly to keep it from fogging up I then have a gun-sight looking thing hanging from the bottom of the face shield and obstructing my view. This helmet does not play well with glasses, fitting them into the helmet is difficult and unlike other modulars I am unable to put this helmet on or take it off without first removing my glasses. For the money I expected better build quality in places. HJC and Scorpion sell Made in China modulars just like this helmet for a third of the price that have better quality and design for just a trade off in a little bit more weight. I think AGV/Dainese is trying to sell a $300 helmet for $800 here, your money is better spent of other options.\n",

      "Want to love this helmet so bad because literally everything is great except the chin strap. I'm stuck with it at this point but am super upset I purchased it without the ability to return it. I did not buy on Revzilla but elsewhere. Big mistake. It is light and quiet with great vision. Love modular helmets as its hot in Texas where I ride. Will plan to purchase another as soon as they fix the chin strap. This one will become my passenger helmet I guess...\n",

Of the 6 helmets I own by various manufacturers, it is without a question, the loudest helmet I have ever worn. It is louder than riding without a helmet! It is comedic to compare this to the Schuberth C3 Pro, which categorically destroys this helmet.Very disappointed in this exorbitant purchase, and the misleading info of it being \"slightly louder\" than comparative helmets.\n",

      "Picked up am AGV SM in the White/Carbon flavor and of course, it's beautiful and light, but we all knew that was a given. It's like seeing that petite model in a magazine, sure she looks amazing, and you know she'll cost a lot, but is she worth it and can you live with her every day? First off the fit is a little different than a Neotec II or a C3. The first thing I noticed was how shallow the side cheek pads come forward as opposed to the Shoei, which come all the was down 3/4 of my jawline. The SM cheek pads stay further back, so it just felt different coming from a full face. I wear a Medium in just about everything Shoei, so the Medium SM cheek pads felt tight for a while as the pressure point was squarely on my TMJ and it took some getting used to. Secondly was the chin strap people talk so much about. I thought to myself \"It can't be that bad can it?\" - Well if I had to make a decision on this helmet based on my impressions over the first 5 minutes, I'd have sent it back. Because the cut of the helmet brings everything further back (see cheek pads) than other modulars, it brings the chin strap further back as well. It feels different for sure, but I kept it a hair looser than I would my race helmet and that helped for sure. I've also experimented with tucking the chin strap padding up and out of the way and that was made a difference. That padding can be cut to a shorter length and it might make a huge difference to some, and for me I've gotten used to the strap as long as I don't cinch it down super tight. On the street I ride a FZ-09 with a Puig windscreen and the first thing I noticed was how absolutely neutral the helmet stays in the wind. Buffeting is kept at an absolute minimum. This is a big deal for me as fighting a helmet on a naked for me, leads to neck fatigue after being on the bike all day. I thought the weight was going to be the reason my neck thanked me but combined with the aero on this helmet, I've put over 1000 miles on it and its just amazing in that aspect. I love the way the helmet fits my head and my face. I ride with a Heat-Out CoolR skull cap mostly to keep my earplugs in. With this helmet, I am not using comms yet so I have a pair of bluetooth earbuds I ride with (the tip must have wings to stay in my ears) and this helmet fits so well. I have removed the small speaker-sized pad from both sides to allow a tad more room for my earbuds, otherwise it was pushing the speaker into my ear creating pressure after about an hour or so. Once I removed the pad it was perfect. The vents are adequate, and once on the freeway and I open the top vent, I can feel the airflow pulling heat from my head even with the the skull cap on. The front vent is like any front vent. Need your teeth dried? The chin bar comes very close to my face, which is fine by me. I'm not into long chin bars on helmets and I love the way the close chin bar created a smaller overall helmet. The visor is super clean works like it should. I got used to the center lock face shield very quickly and it is nice a nice quality. The drop down is a great feature. I often ride with the drop down deployed and the face shield up and that is good to about 50 mph. When I get off from work the sun is in my eyes and I wish the drop down was darker, and I don't see any options to change it out. I have purchased a dark smoke face shield and it is plenty dark so that is a nice option. So after 2 weeks and 1000+ miles I have to say that this helmet is getting better every time I ride with it. As its padding breaks in, it fit me more and more like a glove. The cheek padding is now supple and very comfortable and I had some concerns initially. My neck thanks me for the aero in this helmet and the fact that its about a pound lighter than the competition. Plus the ability to keep it on when I gas up, or look for something in my tail bag, or wanna pound some water or a Red Bull make this an amazing everyday choice for me. Plus the bling factor is never underestimated. It's like oh you rock a modular? Then they see the AGV logo and it's like oh you rock a Sportmodular???\n",

      "They aren't kidding, this thing is insanely light. If you can compare it with the Schuberth or Shoei in person, it's a remarkable difference. Having tried all of them on, the \"Sportmodular\" has a sportier fit. It's tighter in the cheekpads and has more of an all encompassing fit. The Schuberth and Shoei have a plush \"touring\" feel to them, but don't feel quite as secure as the Sportmodular. I personally like the security, but I was with some friends who thought it was too tight. YMMV.It maybe could be quieter, but I haven't had a chance to compare riding to the Shoei and Schuberth. It doesn't seem loud, but I still would like to compare. Sena fits perfect, no problems. Ventilation is solid, but I had to remove the chin curtain for summer riding. It blocked too much air, which will probably be good once the temps start to drop. Overall, 3k miles in and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n",

      "I have 4k miles on the AGV Sportmodular Carbon, the following are needed to perfect it:1. Better airflow - hot above 80 degrees, chin vent ineffective2. Bigger button to open the face shield3. Chin strap quick release4. Too difficult to close modular on the fly. Requires holding the red tab. Very loud if you slap it closed, and then it will NOT latch. This is a safety issue.5. Inner sun shield latch difficult to locate on the fly and doesn’t provide low enough coverage.Bottom line is AGV Carbon is  not as comfortable or well made as the Shuberth or Shoe, but its lighter than both so i use it. If Shuberth gets their act together w more shell sizes and carbon fiber I’ll buy it.\n",

      "This is a good helmet.  But that's it.  Outside of the fact that it's a carbon shell and lightweight...it should be at a price point more akin to around $300....not $700.  The modular lock requires more than one attempt to secure it  properly (consistently proven to be the case).  The visor lock is ill-placed and to be honest unnecessary...and really only serves as an annoyance.  The airflow is lackluster...but louder than I'd expect as well.  The d-ring neck strap is ill placed putting it right against your throat to the degree that it feels like you're being choked at times.  I'm not all that happy with the helmet...and wouldn't buy it again at this price point, or likely any price point.\n",

The noise to me is great. I came from a Bell Revolver so take that with a grain of salt. But this is the do it all helmet I just wish I was able to get a new visor from revzilla but had to order one from the UK. The GT3 visors fit this helmet. Its hard to imagine the rest of the market not following AGV full carbon helmets they are just amazing at this price point. Big Thumbs up from me.\n",

      "Light weight with wide vision.\n",
      "So after much deliberation between Schuberth C4,  Neotec 2 and Agv sportmodular Carbon. I finally leaned towards AGV due to light weight being my biggest criteria. My first impression of the helmet was wow it looks good (smaller profile), feels light and has easy in and out head-liner for cool and warm days switch. Now it came down to fit the Bluetooth which is Sena 10R, I was quite impressed by the sound quality as compared to cardio Bluetooth in my c3 Pro. Easy overall install of the speakers and boom mic, wiring etc. Screen visor  pinlock was an easy install as well. Only place I struggled was removing the visor from the helmet which I finally figured it out.Now it comes down to testing the helmet on a long journey for wind noise level, bluetooth and comfort etc etc. First 30 minute of the ride was good and getting used to the helmet and the view from the visor which was quite clear. Internal smoked sunvisor was slightly dark but not absolutely dark which I can see foresee being an issue when it’s bright outside. To me it was perfectly fine and not an issue. Easy use of the Sena 10R bluetooth functionality with gloves and a low profile look on the helmet was a plus. I was impressed with battery life which lasted more than ten hours of listening  to music and few phone calls. So finally where I felt it lacked was the comfort zone of the cheek pads which gave me a lot of pain in the lower jaw line area after about 30 minutes of riding. I was continually adjusting the helmet to ease the pain but it would slowly trickle back. This is the first time I have experienced such pain in breaking a new helmet in. I have now taken the pads out which btw is integrated with the neck-roll. I have now placed them under heavy books to compress for sometime to see that will make a difference. Now let’s talk about wind noise and I wore my ear plugs first which kept the helmet very quite. Then I wore the helmet without them and it was a significant noise level increase which to be honest I was not expecting. But then I adjusted the head vents and front face air flow which helped a little bit. I will say it is slightly louder than my out going Schuberth c3 Pro for sure. Probably more use of ear plugs :) Build quality looks good but the real test will  be down the line after a year or so to really comment on how this helmet has faired so far. My final verdict is still out on this helmet and with time I would be able to comment more but this was my first impression so far with AGV sportmodular carbon.\n",

      "First off, this helmet rocks. I only have full face helmet experience, albeit with other premium helmets (Race Star, RF-1200, DT-X, Defiant-X, ATR-1, to name a few), but I think that's where many find themselves when looking at the Sportmodular. Pros:-Stupid lightweight-Amazing finish, and good overall aesthetics-Feels very quality (solid, all moving parts do so with reassurance-Feature rich (watch the video)-Basically all of the pluses that AGV advertises-True intermediate oval / Shoei fit-It seems quieter than my RF1200-VERY aerodynamic. -Double D ring. I hate those micro-metric ratchet systemsCons:-Price (although competitive with the C4 and Neotec 2)-Made in China, although the carbon has less imperfections than the made in Italy Pista (go figure)-The cheekpads felt extremely tight when new; more so than all of the models I mentioned above. However they broke in nicely.-You have to rotate the chinbar up to take the helmet on/off. I'm not used to this coming from full face helmets, but I suppose it comes with the modular territory. -The name \"Sportmodular\" is dumb AF. They could have picked literally any Italian word to make this sound as exotic and well made as it is. Some have commented on the chin strap being awkwardly positioned. It's totally fine for me, so I think that really comes down to individual rider face/neck shape. Overall, I have a hard time believing the C4 or Neotec 2 would be any better than this, ESPECIALLY considering the weight of this helmet. I've handled a C4 and Neotec 2 (never rode with them) and personally think the AGV is on part with the Shoei for quality, and trumps Schuberth's new model. The Neotec or C4 might be quieter than the Sportmodular, but honestly the Sportmodular is pretty quiet, so I don't think they'd have much of a leg up. Overall, I think AGV barged into the premium modular game and are disrupting what's always been.\n",

I love the internal sun visor, it works great with one hand flick of the switch.  The sun visor comes way down and shields your face and eyes from the sun.  Has good enough air flow, I wore it in 110 degree heat and was ok.  I used the cool side and warm side of the liner and it was nice to have a choice, it was very easy to switch sides.

My only gripe is that the visor indents aren't very strong and when riding with the visor in the up position it doesn't take much to move around. I am satisfied with the fit, finish and quality overall and would only suggest maybe making the visor mounts a bit stronger and a ratchet strap would definitely be an improvement over the titanium D rings as well.\n",

Fourth, this helmet is quite. Don’t own another modular but this is quiter then my other full face helmets. Fifth, it seems more aero with less buffeting.Now the not so good - Chin strap is awkward but not as tight and a tug down once strapped made all the diff for me. I find the fit a little odd but not as odd as other AGV helmets like the Pista. Overall, the weight, aerodynamics, and visor make this a fantastic helmet. If this is the direction modulars are heading, the future is bright!\n",

      "Just got my new Sport Modular. I am an avid AGV owner and own several AGV helmets. Once I looked at this and saw what it had it was a no brainer to drop the cash due to the type of quality that goes into their helmets.Now I have read all the comments and all are entitled to their opinions, but some, WOW! Like the one about the field of vision being block by when the chinbar is up or that when he is going 80mph the shield closes when it's open, oh and I like the one where he says that rain comes in when he has this shield up, aaaahhhhh, of course rain will come in. The shields UP... Well he goes on and I'm not seeing it here.PROS-  The overall style, perfect. A definite hit between the Pista / Veloce helmets. You can see it.Shield action is perfect in every way, just like on the Pista / Cosra / Veloce. I have all three of these helmets and where AGV fell short was an accessory shield ratchet kit for them.So glad they did it for this helmet. Action is perfect and EASY, yes EASY. When the shield is up, NO the black locking post is not in my line of sight. and when the shield is mid way. It's fine, of course it's in you field of view, what helmet isn't, Duuuhhh.Chinbar operation is simple and no problem. The inside sun visor I love, way better then say the K3 SV, K-5s, or the NUMO. I have the first two I mentioned and don't like the lever that much, but the Sport Mod's slide lever is great.Field of view is awesome. 120 deg I love.Venting is SOOOOO incredible, the best I have ever felt in any helmet out there, so much so that on a cold day I had to close off the vents because my head got super cold.The pad comfort, ONG love it. Super plush, and can't wait to use the flip around top pad for summer /winter use.Weight is so much lighter then the NUMO. I was almost going to get a NUMO, but after trying one on my head, I thought I had a Mark V Divers helmet on.The weight of the Sport Mod is crazy light, lighter feeling then my Pista it seems. Cons- OK now I know this is the first year and this is an all new product, so I can see that something may not be 100% perfect. I expect this in the real world.So what is bad about this (not that bad per say), the fit.I where a Med with most helmets, however not all helmets I know will fit my head. This is not so much a con because everyone may not fit any one helmet perfect. That being said I tried a Med and found it really snug ( more tight really). OK so on to a Lg. Yes this fit better and was not so must pressure to my head.Second con is a little more on the make or break side and I see in the comments that I do agree with those who mention it.The chin strap placement is terrible in the sense that it seems to be set back to far in the helmet, so when you put it on it feels like it's cutting back on your neck (now this may vary with others). Not to good. I have gotten use to it, but this could be better. The other thing is that the chin strap pads move and slide out of place leaving no pad in place to not feel the rubbing of the chin strap. Now this should have been easy to pick up when they [AGV] made the helmet.OK so these are the only things I see wrong, but as I have seen on the reviews the chin strap is a BIG DEAL.These are two very easy thing that should have been picked up on prior to production in my opinion (chin strap placement and chinstrap pads moving).The chin strap pads moving was the most simple to fix. The strap to hold it in place was put in the wrong spot, it's to far back and not more forward. So I will add a small piece of material more forward to keep the pad in place while on.The chin strap. this should have been beta tested with multiple riders to see what they thought. Feedback of some sort. I hope it can be changed.OK so its the first all carbon modular helmet out there, Light weight, awesome feature. What could I say in a whole I do love the helmet. The chin strap pads moving, not a killer deal breaker, however the placement of the chin strap is going to be a problem with this helmet for some.This is my opinions on this. I see it as a great helmet and I'm keeping mine.\n",

Consider whether you would recommend this product and what you like or dislike about it.After trying a few different modular helmets. I was really impressed with the weight of the helmet, it was almost as if not wearing a helmet when you combine that aspect with field of vision the helmet offers. The attention to detail on the interior was very impressive as well, quality materials make the helmet feel amazingly comfortable while riding, having the reversible crown pad was a HUGE!!! plus for me as i ride in many different climates sometimes hot and sometimes cold. To top it all off the helmet (for being a modular) is absolutely beautiful, considering most modular helmets look big and cumbersome. I've had a few friends of mine not even realize it was a modular until i opened the the front of the helmet. I am over all very satisfied with the helmet and would recommend it to anyone looking for a modular helmet.\n",

Neck strap was, as another review mentioned, too far rearward, felt like I was being strangled.I'm returning it.  I really wanted to like it because it is very light - feels like almost nothing on my head.OTOH, my wife purchased hers at the same time and she really likes it - the # 1 and 2 issues with mine does not occur with hers.

      "I had been hearing about this helmet for a while and was hoping to get one in my hands to see if it was going to be as light as it was being advertised. I have had Shoei and Schuberth, but both suffered from being heavy, one more than the other. Having had neck surgery weight is a big deal to me. I was leaning towards picking up another Schuberth until I was able to get my hands on the AGV. All I could say is wow this thing is LIGHT.My biggest concern is what would I be giving up for the weight savings. It turns out I didnt give anything up. The helmet is everything as advertised.I have never owned an AGV before, because when I had tried them on in the past they didnt fit my head, so I was surprised how well it fit. It fits like my old Shoei, which is a lot to say because I loved the fit of that helmet. So I was just down in Dayton for bike week and we crisscrossed the state, all I can tell you is I could not be happier with this lid. My SENA system went right in, the visor works great, the helmet is super quite, like insanely quite. Of course it was Florida so we got caught in the rain a few times and the PinLock worked perfectly, water tight everywhere, not even a drop got in, and I got to use the reversible crown pad, because it went from cold to hot on our drive down, and this is a great feature. No need to put on a skull cap or doo-rag to stay warm or keep the sweat out...Im Bald it makes a difference.  I really cant find anything wrong with it. I read the other reviews about the little locking clip on the visor, and to tell you the truth I didn't event notice it, until I read about it in the other reviews. It doesn't bother me one bit. The thing that does stand out to me about the visor is the insane amount of view I get when I close the chin. I have never had a helmet with this big a field of vision that wasn't a 3/4 Lid That all said i'm super happy with my purchase and so glad that AGV made a helmet this light with these features. I highly recommend this helmet\n",

      "I thought I was too young to start riding with modular helmets until I got to try on this helmet at the motorcycle show in Chicago. The weight is the first thing you notice. It's killer. The design and the number of air vents made it very appealing. However, I was skeptical about the two rings locking system. I like to be able to operate the locking system with my gloves.The Indian sales guy was extremely knowledgeable and he got me. With the good weather, I started to use it more and more on my Versys and I realized it's more than just a modular helmet, as it comes with a wide range of features that are typical of sporty helmets.In the end, I haven't started to use modular helmets yet, because this isn't one. The wide vision, the lightweight, the double rings system and the safety level all make me think of my loved AGV Corsa helmet. It happens to have a lid that can be opened at the red light - I love it.\n",

      "Overall, the helmet is great (design, features, materials) but the placement and angle of the chin strap, in my opinion, is a minor but serious design flaw that will affect comfort and/or safety. Therefore, I will be returning this helmet but will gladly repurchase the helmet once the issue has been resolved.\n",

      "Today I’ve received my AGV Sport modular in Carbon Fiber glossy finish and after wearing it for some 3 hours I would like to report my thoughts with anyone thinking of purchasing  AGV’s  Sport modular.Its really a beautiful helmet even nicer than my Schubeth’s  C3 Pro Observer. The carbon fiber finish is simply perfect ! I never had a helmet that fitted me as well as THE Sport Modular. right out of the Box it was very confortable with no pressure points. The visor mechanism is of the highest holding quality and is very easy to remove and reinstall the shield.The fabric used in the internal parts, as well, is excellent and very confortable. I love the Idea of being able to choose winter and summer sides; very smart !To be perfect I would suggest AGV makes some small improovements:1 Make the flip up chin guard open a little bit more, perhaps one notch. When riding with the chin guard in the open position it still remains a little bit in one’s field of vision2Add another one or two deterrants points to the visor. The first stop opens it is too much for riding in the rain and the last one is short of opening the visor enough as, all open, its still in yor field of vision, particularly the Black plastic piece that engages when closing the visor. Eventhough this piece is removable, as its attached with one screw, it should be made of transparent plastic rather than black. Also removing it does not allow for a small opening as there are no deterrant stops to keep it slghtly open once you remove this plastic piece.3Eventhough the plastic detents for the visor are sturdy allowing me to ride with an open visor up to 130Km p/ hour before it closes itself  (BMW GSAW Adventure) it could have  a litlle stronger detents to allow for higher speed without closing itself.4Personnaly I would remove the visor plastic lock as in my over 40 years of riding I ‘ve never seen a visor open up duet to wind or speed and,  as far as I am concerned it only makes it harder to open the visor.The visor is the very best I’ve seen to date: its absolutelly clear and hás no distortion. The same holds true regarding the sun visor.Fit and finish runs from excellent to very good.My  biggest disapointment comes to its weight ! AGV advertises it as 1295 grams hemet, probably na XS size. I weighted mine, na XL size and got 1580 grams ! My C3 Pro weights 1760 gr. Although 180 grams lighter, both are 60/61 size, I expected a grater weight saving. I would have bought this helmet even if I was informed that on this size it weighted the 1580 grams. The difference is that I wouldn’t have felt cheated !Still, overall I find it the very best helmet I’ve ever own or used !\n",

      "Chin Strap? More like garrote.\n",
      "Sadly I have to return this otherwise fine helmet that I was anxiously awaiting due to the angle of the chin strap. On my small neck the strap pulls back against my throat instead of up under the chin. I wore it around the house for 2 hours re arranging the angle of the strap and trying to convince myself that I could get used to it. However, the helmet is too expensive for me to ignore the discomfort.On the other hand the helmet is incredibly light. The liner is comfy, and a Medium fit my slightly narrow 56.5cm head nicely. Also, in the video it sounded like Anthony said the neck curtain was not removable but it is, and there are 2 sizes of neck curtains included.\n",

      "In total I own 15 helmets...I own 3 AGVs... The Ago tri-color,the x3000, and the Pista carbon fiber 70th anniversary.  AGVs are low quality helmets...Expensive AGVs are expensive, low quality helmets.The Ago whisltes, if you turn your head to the side even slighhtly.The x3000 also has a ton of air coming in around the shield, because of poor fitment/craftsmanship.The Pista shield latch stopped clicking about 6 months after purchase.  I just had to press it close and hope.  Then, as I was prepping for a track day, I noticed a stress crack or delamiation beginning at the chin bar.....When this was brought to AGVs attention, they did zero and basically called me a liar.  Revzilla stepped up and offered me a partial refund on their own..an offer I refused, because this was not in any way the fault of Revzilla.  If you want a quality helmet, first of all buy it here because these folks have the best customer service in the industry....second buy an Arai, Shoei, or Shuberth because those are truly QUALITY helmets..\n",

      "I bought this helmet after watching Revzilla's best helmet of 2018 video.  I've been very happy with the helmet so far.  I have logged many miles while wearing the helmet.  There is some noise but no helmet can eliminate all the noise while riding.  This is the quietest helmet I've owned so far though.  Fit and finish is fantastic.  I love how it came not only with a tinted face shield but also came with an anti-fog- insert.  I've seen quite a few reviewers say this insert is junk but I've had zero troubles with mine so far.  Now if I could just find a way to keep my glasses from fogging up when I stop on cool mornings lol.I have installed a Cardo bluetooth communicator with no troubles.  I also do motovlogs and have a GoPro mounted to the front.  The helmet handles the extra weight perfectly.  It was also rather easy running the wires for both the speakers and mic throughout the helmet, without having to remove the lining.Overall I am very satisfied with this helmet and would recommend it to anyone.  Stay vigilant.\n",

Face shield is great but def needs the included pinlock for those cold morning or nights. Helmet is medium loudness while blasting down highway. I feel its right about the same as my rf1200 from shoei. I think ear plugs are always a good idea anyway. Would def recommend this helmet to any of my friends\n",

      "I've always been a fan of HJC helmets. Coming from the land of Motorsports, I was already well familiar with HJC's line of motorsports helmets. Having already been very satisfied in my automotive helmets, I decided to give their motorcycle/powersports helmet a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The RPHA 11 is a great fitting helmet, first impression is that it feels tight especially in the cheekpads however after a few rides to break in the cheek pads it softened up and feels perfect. I wear a medium in the HJC which is on par with every other helmet I've ever owned.I only have two complaints with this helmet:A: The chin strap feels like it's choking you. This is a weird characteristic that I haven't experienced with any other helmet. I got used to it after a little while and it doesn't bother me anymore but when the helmet was still new to me I didn't like wearing it on long rides for that reason.B: The lower two visor detents feel like they aren't hardly there. If I'm riding in stop and go traffic or low speed traffic and I want to keep the visor up a notch or two for extra air flow, it's hard. Barely any wind will blow it down to the last detent which gets annoying. My 10 year old $200 Z1R has better detents than the HJC.That said, this is a race fit helmet, and functions well as such. I like it overall so I'll give it a solid 4/5. Couldn't pick a better helmet for the $$$....except maybe the RPHA 70.\n",

I don’t take it to the track so tear off posts are not necessary but they don’t bother me. All in all I think it’s a great helmet, especially considering it’s under $400\n",

Sent it back for the small and it fits better, more on the snug side but the padding will give as I wear it. Haven’t had it on the road yet but it clearly was designed to move a ton of air for cooling. Another big plus is features for the price. You get clear AND dark visors plus tear off posts and pinlocks for antifog inserts. Great style, features, and airflow for the price\n",

      "This is a follow up review after putting this helmet through its paces for over a year and 12000kms in every condition. I am a size M but went with the suggested size L. Initially the helmet fit me fine but not as snug as I'd like a race helmet to fit. Now that the cheeks pads have worn in, the helmet is kinda loose. It sort of  \"drops down\" in the chin and forehead area. Although this is not a major issue and the helmet is still a good fit but I just prefer to have the helmet higher than my brow level.So I'd suggest sticking to your regular sizing and since this is a race helmet, it should fit snug. Try it on first before ordering a size up. One thing to point out is the Helmet is not as plush as other  \"premium helmets\". Esp the cheeks pads are not as plush and soft as my previous Shark helmet. But this helmet excels in lightness and ventilation. It's a champ in hot weather and it almost like feels like you are riding with the visor lifted up. Although don't expect to not sweat at stop signals or slow traffic with the visor fully shut.The visor does fog up after a long ride even with the pinlock. The helmet has stood the test of time and I'm really happy with this purchase. May be il buy the M size for my next purchase.\n",

      "Sharp Review\n",
      "I would like to say, I don't owne this helmet. I was looking at the Sharp safety review and the top and the top front, along with the back of the head, the helmet does as well as it can do with green spots. The left side gets a black spot and the right side get a red spot. The red means the helmet will allow up to 500 G's of force. The left side will allow over 500 G's of force to your head. After 275 G's or 300 G's your skull starts to fracture. When you pass 300 G's you're at the point of becoming fatal. I can't speak about air flow or noise or fit or any other things that people are talking about, but the Sharp rating is something I think, people should consider. If you're about to buy this helmet, for what it was intended for, your safety, then you should know about the Sharp review. I filled in all of the reviews, because it will not let me submit it if I didn't. I just put in what Anthony said. I'm not saying he is right or wrong, but it's all I have to go by from a professional opinion on this website. I hope people will look at Sharp, to see about the helmet they may be buying, their life's are on the line. I don't feel Sharp is the only place to look at ,but it is one places that tries to give a unbiased opinion that I've found.\n",

It feels so light compared to the 10, field of vision has also improved tremendously, also there are many extra functional vents, I just adore this lid.

      "Wow. I bought this helmet after doing months and months of research into what the best full-face helmet for hot weather is. I live in south Florida, where temps can reach mid-to-high 90's with very high humidity.Simply put, this is the best full-face helmet for hot weather. The venting is amazing, and there's almost no need for the pinlock visor even though it comes with one. Controls are easy to work with gloves on.Two negatives.1) There's a little black tab on the center visor clip that locks the visor closed. If you thumb it accidentally, you can't open the visor unless you slide the tab back the other way. Kinda stupid, not sure why it's there, and I got trapped in my helmet the first time I accidentally slid it over.2) Installing the chin curtain could qualify as an olympic event. If is RIDICULOUSLY difficult to affix, and the whole time I was installing it, I was wondering if I was going to break something  as the plastic mounting piece slips in-between two seemingly inseparable trim pieces. Works well, and I guess they don't want it slipping out all the time, but still. Crazy difficult to put on.\n",

      "Insane value, quality and functionality at its finest.\n",
      "This helmet is an unbelievable joy to wear. I ride year-round with my motorcycle as my commuter in AZ. My neck doesn't cramp up when I wear it. My eyeglasses are so easy to put on compared to my Shoei GT-Air. The airflow is actually noticeable in this helmet whereas with quite a few others I've tried (even Shoei) it seems like my head would have to be wet to even notice it. All the vents are easy to find even the forehead vent with winter gloves on. Lens system is crazy easy to change and especially nice that a tinted lens is included in the box and a pinlock lens. If you crack the lens into city position and ride over a decent bump, it does pop back down easily but is easy to find again when pushing up into the detent rather than downwards which Revzilla failed to mention. If you want to find the city position just pull the visor all the way down and then up one quickly. Simple. The detents are very nice and positive. Plus, if you're a decent street rider, you should be going around those bumps and hopefully the roads in your area are maintained so it isn't that frequent of a problem.  I'm a guy who greatly appreciates value and functionality and when you have the option of something like this it almost seems wasteful to bother spending more on other helmets when this basically does it all for average riders while still being a high quality piece of gear. Only other reason I can think of for spending more is on race track helmets. I wish I had known about the RPHA 70 ST helmet before I got this helmet because I do like that drop down sun visor but even so, I still have no real complaints about this helmet. Like I said, the fact that it comes with a clear lens, tinted lens, pinlock lens, and is so easy to change, it's not a big issue for me. I, without a single doubt, love the hell out of this helmet.\n",

First day I rode for 200 in the heat of South Florida both on the highway and in stop-go city traffic.I'm using this as a commuter in the upright riding position (I ride a Suzuki C90 cruiser bike). So Anthony, I'm gonna have to disagree with your 'race track' only assessment. I chose to wear a full face on my cruiser for safety and protection from the elements since my motorcycle doesn't have a wind screen. So now to the many many PROS.PROS:-Comfortable and snug: I wear a LG and the helmet fits and feels great. It's also very light and a joy to wear. Especially on commutes and when I ride into Miami. It's stable at Highway speed (70-85mph). Head checking that terrible Miami driver behind me is easy and the field of vision is great!-Quiet: My first helmet was an off brand modular helmet and it was heavy and terrible. This helmet (to me) is nice and quiet. I do find the RF1200 slightly quieter.-2 visors and a pinlock insert: Some serious bang for the buck right here. A clear and dark smoke visor with a pinlock insert in the box. I went with the HJC over the RF1200 because of this outstanding value. -Air Flow: This thing flows a ton of air and is great in the South Florida Heat. With all vents open on the HWY its like i've got the AC going. The City position is also very handy and effective in stop-go traffic. -Style: I got this thing in the Matt Black. With the dark smoke visor on it look so badass. I love it. I definitely wear my helmet all the time. -Speaker pockets: I also installed a Sena 3S-W on this bad boy. It has a shallow recess for speakers behind some removeable pad, Like Anthony pointed out. They've already got velcro there as well. The spakers on the 3S-W are WAAAAY thicker than the newer nicer stuff. However I was able to fit them in there no problem. I do fee that the speaker grate is very close to my ear. Almost touching in fact. But i'm not a primadonna, and that doesn't bother me when my tunes and navigation is talking to me. At HWY speeds I'm able to clearly hear everything going on. CONS:-If the top vents are half closed, the helmet whistles a little bit. I was able to remedy this by tilting my head forward. When the vents are fully closed or opened it doesn't whistle.-Pinlock insert is a little delicate. I don't recommend switching it between visors. Just buy another one like I did.Very very satisfied with the helmet. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend. You get a lot of helmet for just under $400.\n",

      "The large fit my 58cm round head quite well, my head is rather broad and the helmet did not feel narrow once on, but the bottom of the shell did flex when I slipped it Over my head. Airflow is pretty good on the top of the head but lacking in the chin area imo. I didn't like this helmet because the shape is narrow towards the neck and broad at the top of the head/forehead, I though this looked goofy. But it is a really nice comfortable helmet, not too tough to get on like most race helmets. I really liked the speaker cutouts in the ears that already have velcro installed, my iAsus XSound 3 speakers fit perfectly with no modification.\n",

      "I do not agree with Anthony's recommendation of going up one size. Nor do I agree this helmet is only good for full tuck or 3/4 tuck riding. This helmet does fit snug, but I suggest going with the size chart provided by HJC. I also ride a bike that is fully upright  (Kawi Versys 1000) and this helmet feels extremely well ventilated. My guess would be you would have even more ventilation on a super sport in the tuck position. I bought the solid white because I wanted every advantage I can have to beat the heat. I live in Southeast Louisiana and it is extremely hot and humid for six months of the year. I normally have to ride with my visor cracked but not with this helmet! My ride today was in 85 degrees temputures with a heat index of about 98 degrees and I was truly amazed at how much airflow I felt on my face. There is a bit more wind noise but nothing I would consider excessive. And for the amount of ventilation you get I would say it is a more than fair trade-off. The helmet is extremely light and the field of vision is nice and wide. It also comes with a clear and smoke visor which is an additional $35 to $45 value depending on what color or tint you get.Overall, I would highly recommend this helmet to anyone in a hot climate regardless of your riding position..Also, go with what the size chart provided by HJC says, unless you like your helmet to be on the loose side.Sorry Anthony......??\n",

      "This is a great affordable helmet.  I was deciding between the shoei RF 1200 and the HJC RPHA 11 Pro and the RPHA felt more comfortable to me.  Plus the second tinted shield is a nice plus.  The price was a big deciding factor for me as well, especially since it was 10% off HJC products at the time I bought it.  It was also easy to install my SENA 10s headset in the helmet, which did have the recesses for the speakers.  One drawback I have is that the shield does seem to fog up easy when completely closed at a stop. However, if you crack it open like for city riding, that usually fixes it.  There was a \"fog resistant\" film that came with the helmet for the shield, but I haven't tried it yet.  All in all I am very happy with the purchase so far.\n",

      "I picked this helmet up earlier today and spent the afternoon on my CBR600 tracing over every curve within 30 miles of the garage.  My first impression of this helmet was that it was lightweight.  I mean, really light weight.  I am right between a medium and large in helmets and though I respect what Anthony has to say, I ended up going with the medium after trying both on.  Its tight, but its supposed to be. My second impression was, its a fine looking lid.  Its aggressively styled, but without trying to hard.  Just a really good looking lid.  The view port is generous and the visor offers little to no distortion, top to bottom or side to side.  I was thrilled with how well my glasses fit into this helmet without causing pain in those pressure points just behind my ears after extended time on the bike.  Also, the helmet came with a pinlock and an additional smoke-tinted visor in the box.  These are both items that I would have likely purchased separately if they hadn't.  I believe this to be a minimum of at least a $50.00 value.  The HJC helmets that I have owned in the past all have a really easy visor release mechanism and the RPHA 11 is no different.  In fact, it's release feels smoother and altogether upgraded from the CL17 I had been previously using.  The venting was adequate though a little noisy.  It was cool out today so I closed the ports about halfway through the ride.  This helmet is a tad bit noisier than I expected but not annoyingly so.  I believe a lot of the noise factor is due to the ample room that HJC left around my ears which, as I stated above, is great for getting my specs on under my helmet.  Its a trade off that this four-eyed rider would make every day of the week.  In the tuck and around the corners the RPHA 11 is absolutely amazing!  Its 100% a focus first helmet, meaning that it in no way distracts from what I'm doing while I'm doing it.  One of the best qualities of this helmet was somewhat unexpected.  past helmets of mine have rubbed or caught against the top of my back protector while looking through a sharp turn.  Its very distracting when that happens but I had come to just accept that this was part of riding.  This helmet interfaced with the rest of my gear seamlessly.  No rub, no catch.  Just freedom to look and move where I want, when I want.  After I got back home, I put my SENA intercom on the helmet and if I have to knock the RHPA 11 anywhere its in this interface.  The emergency pull cheek pads made running the speaker wires cleanly a bit of a chore and reinserting the pads took a little while to figure out.  (Tip:  The little red disks that interface with the pads are loose snaps.  Pull them out of the helmet and place them in the pad before you slide everything back into place).  This helmet was made more for track riding and so I can't knock it too hard for not being accommodating to the intercom.  When I get to the track the SENA will have to go and be reinstalled again later.  Hopefully with a little experience the install will get quicker.  In summery, I am just thrilled with this helmet.  For the price, I haven't found anything out there that is lighter, more comfortable, vents more air, etc.  Add in the pinlock and the extra visor and the RPHA 11 is a steal.\n",

      "Great fit, slightly noisy\n",
      "This helmet fit my head better than the others I tried on (including a Schuberth.) Weight is reasonably light and I don't have a lot of trouble with drag, but I have a small wind screen. Airflow is reasonable (I live in Texas). I did run into a minor issue where the cheek pad came out every time I took the helmet off. As it turns out, the emergency removal clips just needed to be pressed into place. My local dealer helped me figure this out. My attempts at contacting HJC customer support resulted in no response whatsoever. I don't believe that I can count on HJC to support their products given this experience. I do trust my dealer to help me out, however. Noise is an issue. This is a loud helmet and I do wear ear plugs for longer rides. I'm on a reasonably quiet bike -- wind noise is the problem here. I suppose there are some who would suggest wearing ear plugs no matter what (and I probably would anyway). Nothing is perfect. My older Shoei helmet was quieter. I'd buy this helmet again given the fit.\n",

      "Haven't gotten to get out and ride with the helmet yet, will update when I do.I was torn between the RPHA 10 and 11, mostly due to the significant price difference but watching the RPHA 11 video swayed me over - and I'm glad I did. I've gotten back into motos from about 15 years ago, so helmet tech I'm familiar with follows suit. Definitely night and day from back then. The lining and fit of the helmet itself are as discussed in the video - perfectly snug but very comfortable. Hopefully it stays that way over time. Very impressed with the ease of shield removal, which leads to the ease of assembly of the Pinlock system - painless installation, and both clear and smoke shields come with the Pinlock pins so swapping will be easy.Ventilation, though not tested, sure does look quite good. Plenty of vents as well as intuitive and easily operated controls.Noise is TBD, hopefully it's a good as is reported. Fit and finish is top notch.\n",

      "Sorry this review isn't complete. I haven't worn it on the track as I just picked it up this morning. I just thought I would give others here a quick heads up.  I watched the review here, Revzilla was recommending to go down a size, another video review that I watched recommended not doing that. I was originally going to order a size up. This helmet is race fit... I found it slightly snug. It wasn't uncomfortable at all. I have had an HJC, 3 Shoeis, 2 Bell, 2 Scorpion helmets in the past all Mediums. I measured around 22.7 and ordered a Medium on this one too....The helmet is noticeably lighter than my Bell Star Carbon (2015) and my Scorpion EXO 2000. The finish is awesome and I was impressed. HJC isn't a super exciting helmet but I replace my helmets every 2-3yrs. I don't spend big bucks on them. This helmet seems like a great bang for the buck.I will be back to edit and further review this helmet in June/2017 I would like to leave feedback on it for airflow. It will be used primarily for track.\n",

      "I purchased the HJC RPHA 11 Spicho, Matt Greyit's not made in US yet :)  but its the same helmet, just different graphics. After riding this for 3 months, here are some of my thoughts:PRO:- light and agile- great price base w/ the features you get- excellent airflow/venting- changing visor mechanism : easy and efficient- interior comfort on head and face (nice & soft)- Roller ball on the top vent have great response (with glove)- comes with two visor, a clear and smoke.  but only 1 pinlock (this also be a minor con, since you have to buy another pinlock)- High Quality Graphic FinishCON:- Visor (even with pinlock) can fog up after longer rides in colder temperature. - relatively loud for a \"premium helmet\"- Confusing on Sizing, 1/2 to one size up does apply here- comes with two visor, but only 1 pinlock- drag on helmet... aerodynamic does run into an issueConclusion:I do like his helmet, but I cannot say this is my favorite due to some of the cons I listed above. That is why I can give this a 4 star rather than 5. To be fair, I would give it a 4.5 star.  With that price however, it does provide lots of functions comparing to other premium helmet brands. I also have to add that, the helmet shape doesn't look as cool or sexy comparing to the SHOEIs, AGVs or ARAI. ----I use some of my review base on the current Helmets I own:HJC RPHA 11, HJC CL17SHOEI GTAIR, RF1200SHARK SKAWLAGV AX8 NAKED CARBONICON AIRMADA\n",

      "I got the matte black rpha 11 pro. So far, the only thing I don't like is the metal grill (chin vent) on one side is not seated property. It is misaligned. Other than that, the helmet seems to be exactly what I needed.The helmet fits small and tight. That's what I need! I have a Shoei RF 1200 in size XS and it fits snug. Problems with the Shoei for me are that it buffets a lot at high speed. It also let's in air just forward of my ears from the cheek pads. The other thing is my ears. I MUST wear a headscarf over the top of my ears to put the Shoei on. If i don't, my ears WILL fold over and I can't get them unfolded. I have a Sena comm unit installed but having the speakers in or not does nothing about my ears folding over. I'm hoping the RPHA 11 Pro size XS will address the three things I don't like about the Shoei RF 1200. The RPHA is more of a race helmet than the Shoei. The Shoei is a exceedingly fantastic street helmet. I can't praise the RF 1200 enough but the ear folding, buffeting and air leak lead me to look at other helmets for spirited riding. I tried the Scorpion EXO R2000 and returned it. The XS was way too large, the helmet was noisy, comm unit speakers did not fit (pressed on and rubbed my ears) and I did not like the quality. The center forehead vent was raising up. The adhesive used was not strong enough to keep it held down. Enter the HJC RPHA 11 Pro Aside from the chin vent grill being slightly askew, the helmet is impressive. It fits very similar to the RF 1200. I have the RPHA 11 in size XS and it fits tightly around the face, neck and jaw. There is slightly more room than I would like in the crown, mainly the sides of my head at the temples. I hope HJC will be making larger size cheek pads and comfort liners to address this although the cheek pads are fine as is (for me).Just walking around in my house, I can feel  the ventilation of this helmet. The chin vents are amazing. The forehead vents and chimney vents work wonderfully and you can actually feel the air inside the helmet. The RPHA 11 Pro vents Waaaaaay better than the Shoei RF 1200.I CAN PUT THIS HELMET ON WITHOUT MY EARS FOLDING! This is a first for me as I have always had to either unfold my ears after donning a helmet or as with the Shoei, wear a head scarf over the top of my ears to prevent them from folding over. I am truly impressed with the RPHA 11 Pro fit as this will allow me to wear the HJC without anything on my head and that will only increase my ability to feel the air from the forehead and chimney vents.The chin strap is comfortable and well padded. Much better than the Shoei.My Sena comm unit speakers fit and they fit comfortably! No modification needed. Just take out the ear pads and pop in the speakers. The speakers are right up to my ears but they don't touch, rub or press against my ears.The visor is very good. The visor change mechanism is quick and easy. The Shoei visor change is very good, quick and easy but HJC has em beat hands down on this. I do wish the visor was a bit thicker but it is NOT a thin, cheap visor by a long shot.Vision out the visor is excellent up, down and side to side. I cab barely see the helmet when it's on my head. Tucked vision is very good. I also like the center latch and lock. It's convenient and it truly locks the visor. The visor has a positive seal around the gasket thanks to it being spring loaded. (This is not mentioned in the video)It's cold here in D.C. so I have not been able to take this helmet to task yet. This is a preliminary review if the HJC RPHA 11 Pro and my first impressions. Can't wait for warm weather so I can really put this helmet through its paces.?Stay tuned for the update that will come in the spring after I've put some miles on this helmet.\n",

      "I was very excited about this helmet after watching your review. I loved this helmet until I tried to come up from a full tuck. This helmet has more drag than any helmet I have ever tried. It is even worse on the interstate with wind from other vehicles. I thought at first I just had it positioned wrong, but nothing I did seamed to help the wind resistance. It’s just a constant pull at first but once I reached around 60 mph it became very miserable to wear. I’ve bought a lot of items from RevZilla and was always satisfied until receiving the RPHA 11 Pro.\n",

      "I've had this helmet over 6 months and logged almost 5,000 miles with it.  I'm going to list the things I don't like first because this helmet is definitely NOT worth the price.  The fit is weird.  I followed the size chart and the circumference and cheek pads are fine, but either my chin touches the chin bar or my nose touches the breath guard depending on how the helmet is on my head.  This is really distracting and uncomfortable.  It got better after the pads wore in but it's still incredibly awkward and shouldn't be happening.The cheap plastic screws holding the spoiler on will snap off inside the helmet at the slightest bump to the spoiler.  I removed my spoiler after they broke and I get no buffeting anyways (up to 140 mph at least) which makes me wonder if it's worth the added neck strain to have it.The matte finish is far too delicate and scratches off easily.  Don't ever hang this helmet under a bar on purse hooks.Peripheral vision is bad.  Given the intended riding position of a 3/4 tuck the part of the visor opening where your cheek bones are blocks a pretty critical part of your field of view forcing you to have to turn your head further to compensate.There's no detents or no spring loaded visor mechanism holding the visor in place. It WILL get very loose over time and will slam shut on you regularly and more easily over time. The metal pin holding the visor in place on the opening mechanism is made of cast metal.  One of the tabs on mine snapped off from swapping my tinted visor out.  This was a $60 part to fix it myself.Strap is an inch too short.  If they did this to save weight they should have built it out of carbon fiber like most other top tier helmets that are even lower than this price point.The snap at the end of the straps is almost impossible to click together.  This is really frustrating especially if you are wearing your gloves already.  I've never seen a helmet with snaps that are this poor.The bottom seems much closer to my chin than other helmets which makes me feel like it's probably supposed to be used with a neck brace or racing hump.  It's probably fine but i could see this giving some people an irrational fear that they will be sliding on their chin if they go down and the helmet shifts.The replacement parts and tinted visors are hellishly over-priced.  AGV will not respond to customer service tickets posted on their site even if you translate it to Italian first.PROS: snug and comfortable padding, decent ventilation, thick visor. not incredibly noisy but definitely not quiet.  Works well in both warm and cold temp with the given padding and vents.\n",

      "Track helmet only\n",
      "This helmet is track helmet and I recommend it if you do track duty, but for the street, and if I could do it again, I'd save myself a ton of cash and get the Veloce as it's basically a street version of the Corsa R.The size small in the Corsa R, is the smallest shell size AGV currently makes, and is the most compact low profile helmet I've ever owned (and I've got Shoei RF1200, Arai Vector 2, Arai Defiant and Schuberth C3).  So size wise if you are looking for compact, zero bobblehead effect, AGV has it for you here (and with the Veloce).  In fact it's so compact, my chin rests right along the front of the chin bar.Quietness:   it's a track helmet and it's designed for someone wearing ear plugs.  However I wouldn't say it's any louder than my Arai Defiant.On comfort:   It's rather lumpy feeling inside, not plush like my Arai's or Schuberth lids.  So after a few hours it begins to bother the top sides of my head.Field of view:  .I really expected this to be a huge wide view like my AGV AX-8 naked....but it's not.  In fact I'd say it's narrow on side to side, but top to bottom it's got plenty of view.Weight:  It's nothing special in terms of lightness, but it's so compact it feels like you really don't have any additional mass on your head, which is great.Buffetting:  It's outstanding.  In fact it's as good as my Schuberth C3.  Very little uplight at high speeds.Style:  This is probably the reason I got this helmet if I'm honest.  It looks sick, I got the black with the gold visor and it's sharp looking.  However, both helmet and visor are unusually prone to fingerprints, to the point it's almost annoying to me personally.  Air flow is pretty good.  I still think my Arai Vector 2 beats it, but not by much.  So good air flow if you live in hot climates this will be acceptable.In conclusion, I recommend it for the track, but that's it.  If it's street riding you do, get the Veloce, it's basically the same thing, same size shell, same visor but will be way cheaper and more comfortable.\n",

      "Coming from a shoei x14 which I crashed in, this helmet is by far my favorite. My head never fit into the shape of arai and shoei without feeling pressure points, this helmet however feels like it was made for me. It's slightly wider in areas near the ear/crown which the shoei and arai helmet lacked. Makes for a very comfortable fit. Helmet DOES sit close to chin. Slim fit.FIRST IMPRESSION: it felt like nothing was on my head the first time I took it out riding, compared to the x14 which has much denser liners. At 40-70mph, the Corsa cuts through wind perfectly with its slim design making it easy to turn your head from side to side at speed. 100+ idc what helmet you're in, you're going to feel wind resistance if not in tuck.This helmet is much nicer in build quality compared to the original Corsa(being made in Italy helped). It is quieter, however I recommend earplugs for extended highway runs.I will say I highsided in the shoei going about 55, and the first thing I thought was that didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought it would! Hopefully I don't have to test the Corsa R! Both the shoei x14 and Corsa R (even the Corsair X) are great helmets, get whichever one fits you best! Btw you can totally mount a Sena on the helmet!\n",

      "The Corsa saved my life few months ago when I T-boned a car going 80 miles. I landed on my head and I cant believe I'm here able to tell this story.Now I am riding with the new Corsa R. The R version is the natural evolution: same look but it seems like AGV paid more attention to the details: great interiors and the stock wide Pinlock really makes a big difference - No more fogging. I love it!\n",

      "Great helmet\n",
      "I'm in love with this helmet. Takes a little bit to wear in the pads and get the true fit. I've had mine now for about 2 weeks and it feels great. Air flow is simply amazing, if you open the center vent it actually feels like you have a huge hole right over your forehead. Despite what the video overview and Anthony says, you definitely can mount a Sena on this. I used the sticky mount and even though I was a bit scared it wouldn't stick well enough for high speeds. After 155 mph for an extended time, it held up fine. I however didn't mount the speakers, as I really never use them and ride with some Shure 315 earbuds in all the time anyway.Other than that, the helmet is just damn sexy, I mean look at the thing. No wind buffeting what so ever, I could pull my head out of the tuck at 155 mph and it didn't even feel like I was moving. Simply amazing!My only gripe with the helmet is it doesn't come with an antifog visor, but instead a pinlock. Which I wouldn't mind but the pinlock is slightly blue tinted. I ride with sunglasses on don't want to have tint beyond what my sunglasses already provide.Another thing, this is by far the easiest helmet I've ever owned to get sunglasses on underneath. I could actually put on some thick framed glasses in the Corsa. Usually I'm stuck resorting to thin framed glasses like aviators in order to get it passed the padding and over my ears.Great helmet, would recommend to anyone able to drop this kind of money on a helmet.\n",

      "Great versatility and quality\n",
      "My last quality helmet was a full face Arai, so I know what a premium helmet feels like. Given that context, I am impressed with the Valiant, especially at the price. And i love, love, love being able to flip the chin bar all the way back. I live in the tropics and commute 6 miles to work, while sometimes having to visit clients much farther away. I love being able to have an open face helmet for the city, and then flipping it closed when I get on the highway. I do want to say something about fit. It fits my 58cm intermediate oval head very well, but ironically, both the M and L fit exactly the same, except for the thickness of the cheek pads. I chose the M and returned the L. Could it be that the cheek pads really are the only difference between the sizes, as a cost savings? Anyway, doesn't matter to me as the fit is close to perfect. :)A couple of niggles: 1. The action on the visor is not super smooth. I assume this is related to what must be a rather complicated mechanism that flips the visor up automatically when lifting or lowering the chin bar. That works great, btw. Very easy and smooth action when lifting or lowering the chin bar. I tried a friend's Shark Evoline, and the action was much stiffer, but then that helmet was a couple of years old. Anyway, when cracking the visor open to the city position, it is easy to overshoot, as the initial tension holding the visor closed is high. This is really the one area where my Arai was clearly superior.2. Ventilation could be better. It's not been terribly hot here, so it's fine, but airflow could be better. There are channels in the liner, but the intake and exit holes are in different channels. Not sure if that's the reason, but I am having a hard time feeling the airflow. 3. Would be nice to have a D-ring for locking the helmet to the underseat helmet peg, but I think that's rare on helmets with a ratchet closure. 4. There is a vinyl chin skirt that I am not sure is removable, and which blocks the exhaust vents when the chin bar is flipped back. 5. The chrome accents aren't really my thing.Overall I am very happy with it.\n",

      "Not Intermediate Oval.\n",
      "These are my impressions after using the helmet for three months.Fit:First thing first. This helmet is *not* an intermediate oval head-shape as it says in the video. The manufacturer website describes it as round oval. Sadly I didn't discover that until after purchasing.The fit per the size guide is small. Go with a size larger than the guide or better yet try one on in person if possible before ordering online just to be sure.Features:The flip-around chin bar functions smoothly and latches solidly; but the helmet has a decidedly narrower fit with the chin bar closed. The chin bar itself sits very close to your chin when down and doesn't feel like it'd protect much in an impact. The flexibility of being able to flip the whole thing back for lower speed riding is really nice and the mechanism operates easily with one hand while in motion.The integrated sun shield has a smooth action and stays in place, but the actuator is in an odd place for a slide style actuator and will get in the way of an aftermarket com system. The shield itself doesn't seem to fully retract and can be seen in the top of my field of view which I find mildly distracting.Venting:The venting is very nice. The chimney vent is easily opened and closed and vents quite well with the passive rear vents.The chin vent actuator can be tricky to locate, but opens and closes easily enough. When open ventilation is directed both up past the inside of the shield and towards the face.Shield:The shield seals well at points of contact in all configurations with no fogging issues in any position; though I tend to ride with the chin vent open at all times. The location at the top and center for the grab point took a brief amount of time to get used to, but I quite like the location now and hope that other manufacturers start using that location.Noise:Believe it or not the helmet is actually louder with the chin bar in the down position. It's pretty significant. There's no whistling in any configuration, but at 65mph the wind noise is quite pronounced.Liner:The liner is comfortable and causes no pressure points, but it's kind of a pain to get in and out and the plastic \"locking pins\" are not terribly durable and tend to fall out.Com integration:I use the Cardo Packtalk slim and there was a significant amount of MacGuyvering needed in order to get the components in place. The sun shield actuator is located precisely where you would want to put the com controls. The recesses for the ear pieces are not deep enough and the boom mic gets trapped outside of the chin bar more often than not when closing. It's, in short, not a good lid/com combination.Overall I think it's a good first effort for the style on the part of LS2, but could use a lot of refinement and a proper intermediate oval redesign.\n",

      "Love this helmet\n",
      "It's my first helmet, but I really like it! Being able to flip the chin bar back and not just up creates less drag, and its a good solid movement too. Even with the chin bar back you can put the visor down to help protect your eyes, and with the 2nd sun screen visor you're good for day or night rides. I like how its ECE rated too and not just DOTDownsides are there's only 2 shell sizes, so if you fall on the smaller size of either shell it may look a bit larger than needed. Its also not very com unit friendly, there's a thick plastic rim that goes along the bottom of the helmet. I was able to put a Cardo Pack Talk Bold on mine, but it took some work. I used a dremel to make a small slot to run the wires behind the foam padding.Overall I would recommend, if I had to chose another helmet I'm not sure what I'd get, being able to wear it in so many different ways makes it very versatile.\n",

      "I bought LS2 Valiant as my 'touring' helmet in place of my Arai XD-4.  So far, it's doing a admirable job of comfort, appearance and practicality.  A full-face, 3/4 & open-face all in one helmet.  I REALLY like the chin-bar that goes all the way back and out of the air stream.  I like the built in inner-shield and the wide, outer-shield that provides good filed of vision.  Interieor is plush and comfortable, though there's only one top vent, it flows a lot of air.  However, there are 2 things that bothers me. The most critical being the depth of the built-in speaker slot for bike communicator.  I use Sena 10S and the speakers are too thick, it presses up against my ears which bothers me aftera  while.  2nd outer shield can only be used in either fully open or fully closed position; anything in between vibrates due to airflow and blurs my vision,  I guess the weight can be little lighter, but so far, it really hasn't bothered me much.  Outer shell being polycarbonate(?), not sure if it can be lighter.  At the price point, I think LS2 Valiant meets all my requirement for a 'good' touring helmet!  I would highly recommend it.  Oh, I wear size L in Arai, but for the Valiant, I had to go to XL.But, physically, the XL LS2 Valiant is bit smaller than my L-Arai XD-4 compared side/side.  Go figure.\n",

I sent the L back and gave her the XL and ordered a XXL for me. The XXL is still too small for me. I have had several Scorpion, a GMax and a Kabuto all in XL and they all fit like a glove. I checked the size tag in each helmet, and Revzilla sent the right ones.\n",

      "At 2:28 in the Video,He states You have to open the Visor,Before you open the Chin bar. \"Not True\"At 3:38 He contradicts himself, by opening the chin bar without opening the visor first.I ride mostly with the chin bar in the reverse position. I ride 10-14 hour days.I don't have any neck issues at all as far as strain with it being in that position.I close the chin bar when I'm lane splitting or at night only for why I bought the Helmet (Added protection at my discretionThis is a great helmet for the price.A friend has the Shark. It Does Not have any ventilation at all.He said he's buying the LS2.As far as getting the liner out. I sweat constantly.The liner isn't difficult to extract.

      "I love everything about this helmet. I always buy modular style but the ability to make this into an open face as well is just amazing especially on really hot days. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned the face shield is actually fog resistant too so there's not even a need for a pinlock or other fixes. This helmet is true to size and very comfortable. I cant say much about wind noise but I can say that if you are using a SENA with this, you wont have any trouble hearing your music. I also want to give a small shout out to the steel quick release chin strap. I'm not a huge fan of  the D-ring and quick releases are usually plastic but this one being metal makes it feel way more secure for sure.My only small issue about the helmet is the lip on the face shield to lift it up and down is at the top of the shield and not the bottom like I'm use to. This is completely preference based though and I will probably get use to it with time but I get a lot of smudges on my shield trying to find the lip in the mean time lol.\n",

My chin hit the chin bar.  Field of vision was fine.  Padding was sufficient.  Build quality and finish were excellent.  The quick release was better on this than on my other LS2 helmets.  Plenty of venting but I did not ride in the lid.  Guessing on the noise level for a modular.   If it fits you, I would say its an excellent helmet.\n",

      "A lot of safety for a modular.\n",
      "It's a great design, it's well-made and performs better than other modular helmets especially for the price. I'm an intermediate oval head shape and I'm not fat but I'm not skinny either.  My head shape is right at 58.42 and I bought the extra large but after riding with it for about a month or so it loosened up quite a bit and I really wish I would have got the large. The visor is optically correct but the drop-down tinted visor is not,so I find myself using my regular sunglasses instead of the drop-down. Fortunately the helmet works great with glasses as well. I can wear my aviators inside of this thing just fine. My biggest complaint with this helmet is the peripheral vision.  It's so bad that I had to find another helmet because this one feels unsafe. I'm not sure how much of that is the helmets fault though because like I said, I really wish I would have bought the large instead of the extra large and suffered through the break-in period.  I don't know if being a size smaller would have helped with peripheral vision much either way.  I suspect the peripheral was so bad because of the flip up mechanism and the fact that this helmet is so wide.  This helmet has decent ventilation,I've used it in the dead of Summer and the dead of winter and had no issues with it.  It protects against the rain well, too.  The visor will fog up pretty bad, but it's settings are solid and I've had no problems riding with it cracked open even at high speeds.   I would still recommend it,especially if you just gotta  have a modular.\n",

      "I’m real picky about stuff I buy.  It’s rare that I find, and am pleased with,  a product that is versatile, comfortable, and reasonably priced.  So yes I like this helmet, very much.  It’s not perfect but very close in my  opinion.  I’ll high-light the good and bad, and also comment on the Sena LRP 3 communication system I installed (LRP 3 is made specifically for this helmet).  Please note this is the first modular/full face helmet I’ve purchased in over 20 years (been wearing half helmets) so for some of my comments I have no recent comparison product.Good:- The obvious good is how you can configure the helmet: full face, “3/4”, with or without the shield and sun screen.- Eye glasses friendly- The sun screen is really effective- There is no vision distortion when using both the sun screen and clear shield- I have a long-oval head (apparently).  At first I was getting a forehead hotspot with the LS2. I removed the headliners and “massaged” the EPS liner material where I was getting the hotspot.  It’s a now comfortable helmet.- The helmet weight is fine with me. - I really like the ratchet style chin strap- Looks cool.  One dude asked where I got the fighter jet helmet.- You get a lot of value with this helmetBad- It is a bit noisy from wind.  I would have expected it to be more sealed from wind.  And forget about it when opening the top vent.  It vents very well but the noise increases 3X.- For me it is cumbersome to get the helmet on/off, and that’s partly due to the Sena unit.- Cheek pads are real tight with the chin bar down and locked.  I suppose they’ll limber up over time.- I’ve not ridden in the rain yet but it doesn’t appear to me that the helmet’s seal with the clear shield is robust.Sena LRP3- It’s fairly easy to install.  But the helmet speaker cutout areas did not exactly match the physical dimensions of the speakers so some minor EPS “carving” was required.  - A big downside to me is that the electronics of the LRP3 is mounted to both the right and left chin straps (Sena provides chin strap sleeves for this), thus increasing the thickness of the chin straps by ½ “ each.  It is then even MORE cumbersome and difficult to get the helmet on and off. - Another downside is that wind noise partially drowns out the speakers.  You can turn up the volume to hear but that could result in ear damage.  In summary,  I gave this helmet 5 stars due to fit and comfort;  it’s the first helmet I’ve had where I can ride for hours and not have hotspot pains.  The features of the helmet is icing of the cake.  If I could do it over again, I may not opt for the LRP 3. At $200, there might be better options.\n",

      "Perfect compromise\n",
      "I normally wore 3/4 my whole life and I got older and more conservative migrated over to full face specifically shoei RF 1200   excellent snell rated helmet.  Over period of 18 months I noticed my enthusiasm for riding slightly decreased and realized I missed the feeling of open air .  After countless reviews I came across the LS2 Valiant Dot rated full face and 3/4 that enables you change looks on fly .  And with internal visor its perfect compromise for what Im looking for.  I also greatly appreciate new ratchet quick release strap quickly strappin my helmet on and off is literally snap. Yes I hear riders swear all the time D ring  is just as easy - No its not especially with gloves and full hear etc.  Putting the helmet on requires  to be in the open 3/4 configuration .  I usually start off with internal visor  open face then face shield as I pick up speed and full gauntlet mode on the freeway.  Fitment is intermediate oval perfect for my head.  I wear 2 xl but is tight around the jaws once you goto full face mode.  Im sure this will loosen as the helmet breaks in.  I got impatient and ordered face shield for 3xl which .5mm smaller and installed on my 2 xk and fitment is perfect. in summary if your like me that yearns for the open air but want the protection of full face the LS2 valiant is the choice.\n",

      "I have owned a few high end helmets, this one is about equal to those in almost every area except price.  I feel it is a good deal for the $300 price tag compared to others at a higher price.I also have the LS2 Rebellion 1/2 helmet too, so was a good fan of them from that.  I saw this one since I like the modular as they seem to be more forgiving with glasses.  Comfort is nice.  I generally wear a bandanna under my helmet since it reduces the amount of cleaning of the liner and prolongs it a bit in my opinion, but comfort is still there.Since I only have 2 semi negative things to say, I will go with them first since most want to see what is \"wrong\" with the helmets.Noise was a little more than some similar helmets I feel and water seemed to get through (vents were closed..) in a few spots which got the inside visor a bit fun during the rain.  So, maybe could use a better way to seal that or something to make the seal more secure.   The noise level is not too horrible, but higher speeds can certainly hear air leaks.  I like that I can hear my bike roar without too much other crap though.  That is it though for complaints.No wind drag/buffeting up to 100 mph.  Not sure past that, but as it was smooth sailing at that speed (airport drag..) I would say it is good until at least 120 or so.Might weigh more than some, but I really did not notice it.  First time wearing it, I was on the road 4.5 hours and was golden.Action to transform is very smooth.  Saw somebody state you need to open the visor some first, I did not. Once you push the button and move to slide it back, the visor moves with it.  Very smooth action.  Have to say that I was very impressed with that.Don't have the voice coms yet since I have not seen the LRP3 on Revzilla yet, but looks like it would be pretty simple to hook up.  I just hope the controls are not in the neck strap, that may get annoying, esp if you have a beard like me.All in all, this has to be my all time favorite helmets.\n",

      "A Different Kind of Modular\n",
      "This helmet review is based on: features, comfort, style, weight, noise level, and air flow.Features: The chin bar is able to be retracted all the way back.  Personally, this feature is the only reason why I bought this helmet compared to other modular helmets.  Comfort:  This helmet is true to size and is comfortable until you install a speaker system.  I used SENA 20S speakers and the helmet became unbearable to wear for over an hour.  By purchasing the SENA 20S \"slim speakers\", the helmet became instantly comfortable because you have the ability to shift the speakers to a better position.  It is important to note the diameter of the speaker system is smaller, but the girth is unchanged [compared to stock].  Style: Other than Shark, there is no other helmet manufacturer that creates a modular helmet that is DOT rated with the chin bar set back.  I was in the market to purchase a  quiet modular and was flipping back and forth with the AGV modular and Schuberth C3 Pro.  However, I became so infatuated with the style of this helmet, I decided to stick with ear plugs to reduce noise level.  BEWARE, I bought the \"Black\" version of this helmet, and the \"LS2\" logos on the sides were still chrome.  Weight:  This helmet is relatively heavy to begin with.  Add on a communication system and this helmet becomes even more relatively heavy, but not unbearable.  Noise Level: Wear ear plugs.  Air Flow:  With the chinbar down, I do not feel a significant amount of air flow to the top of my head.  The top vent is basically useless, while the chin vent works well.  Though, air flow is not a problem when you use this helmet as a 3/4 open face helmet.\n",

      "If on the fence buy it\n",
      "I bought this helmet to be able to go from open to close face. The mechanism is smooth for opening the chin bar and it automatically ooens the visor to allow it to rotate. I had an old HJC that was pretty loud and this helmet was quiet compared to it. It does have cut outs for speakers and glasses. Its a pain to mount the bluetooth recievers as the sun visor mech sits where i normally mount them. Otherwise its been a perfect helmet and is versatile and alway get compliments on the helmet itself. For saftey i was involved in a low speed collision where a old man did not see me and lane changed into the right of my bike. I went down and i had the chin bar down as i was getting on the freeway. The right side of my helmet made contact and i slid for approximately 20 feet before getting up. The chin bar was not deformed and absorbed the impact as it should have. The material of the shell did a good job of sliding and not grabbing and twisting. The kicker the mechanism still functions like the day i took it out of the box and is smooth. I am actually buying another one i was so impressed with the helmet.\n",

      "Exceeded my expectations\n",
      "OK, first of all, full disclosure. I bought mine while on a trip to Europe. Why? Because in Europe it's available in Bright Chrome! Two words: Bas Ass! My son thinks I have a \"Captain Phasma\" thing going, but another friend said that \"a chrome dome should be protected by a chrome lid\". Both valid points, I guess. I just love the look.All that being said, I was waiting for a while for this helmet to come on the scene. I'm a scooter rider (Honda Forza 300) and live by the motto (from a T shirt in Bermuda) \"Live to ride... Ride to relax!\" I own a Bell Revolver EVO Hi Viz helmet that just never seemed quite right in \"chin bar up\" configuration. Even at 30 mph it still felt like I had a sail on my head. Nice helmet, but just lacking... something. I have listened to dozens of Anthony's reviews of gear, particularly helmets and gloves, and have great respect for his objectivity, experience and insight. I have bought several products based in part on his reviews. On the Valiant, however, he seemed a little negatively biased, and I started to question my interest. Then I tried one on and rapidly developed my own opinion. Simply put, I REALLY like this helmet!My initial ride with the helmet was an eye opener. I rode for over an hour (city and two lane blacktop) and found the helmet very comfortable and much, much quieter than I expected. My safety glasses fit very well through the eyeglass channels and I instantly fell in love with the bayonet-type quick release buckle. The fit gets slightly more snug with the chin bar forward, and loosens up with the bar back, but is not uncomfortable in either position. With the vents closed it is very quiet for a modular, even with the chin bar back. Noise does increase upon opening the chimney vent and chin vent, but the airflow increase makes it a pretty even exchange, to my mind. On an 80 degree day I rode comfortably with the bar back and the chimney vent closed. As opposed to other modulars that I have worn, I absolutely LOVE that you can still use the clear (pinlock - with pinlock insert included) shield with the chin bar back. The drop down internal sun visor is as dark as any sunglasses and has excellent below the eyeline coverage, even when looking down at instruments. This helmet says one thing in my opinion - commuting. An excellent helmet for city riding.If I had one gripe about the helmet it would be about how to integrate bluetooth. I own a Sena 20S system and I still have to figure out how to install it. I know that the Linkin system claims to fit it, but most reviews I have read say that it really isn't meant for this helmet, so I'll keep looking.Comes with a pin lock visor and an inflatable helmet donut for easier removal of pads and liner for cleaning. Lots of \"bang for the buck\" here. This will easily become my go to city, quiet country road helmet, paired with my Scorpion EXO T1200 Alias as my go to highway helmet.Don't be afraid to try this lid!\n",

      "This the worst helmet I’ve ever owned. I’ve been riding over 30 years.  It has lots of features, looks cool and is comfortable to wear- except for its slightly heavy weight. The wind resistance and noise is terrible. The chin bar joint by the ears is not sealed well and makes a ton of noise. The wind really grabs at the helmet and feels like someone is trying to pull it off my head as I ride. I’m actually out here searching for a new helmet and I just bought this 3 months ago.\n",

I ordered the large and it is very snug without using any of the adjusting pads. I really like the helmet and am very happy with it. The modular components do generate some wind noise but it isn't unbearable. I don't know if it would hamper coms devices.\n",

(If no sun, raise the sun visor of course.) Time to cruise at speed... lower the modular chin bar along with the clear and sun (if needed) visor.Weight? I weigh 270 lbs. With all due respect...  I'm not sure if the difference between 3.7 lbs. and 4. whatever pounds is going to really ruin my ride. I really like this helmet.\n",

      "Great competitive qualities to Shark\n",
      "The key to this modular is that the chin guard flips all the way back allowing the openness of a 3/4 helmet. I’ve only had this a short time, but can tell you the fit and finish is better than the Shark that my friend owns. The mechanism to open the chin guard is smooth and effortless. The overall fit is tight for me, especially through the cheeks,but I expect this to break in over time. The view is great with virtually no blind spots on the side view. One negative is that there are no cutouts for speakers, which is an issue if you plan to install a comm unit or Bluetooth device. Overall happy with the purchase.\n",

      "This was my first helmet of modular design and at first I was uneasy about some of the mixed reviews I have heard about the modular design. First off, this helmet is super comfortable and weighs significantly less than I thought it would. It is impressively quiet with the air vents closed and normal noise levels with vents open. Converting this helmet is easy and can be done with one hand, the wind screen needs to be raised one click before you can fully lift the chin bar and is easy on the fly. Whats different from this modular helmet compared to others I have seen is that the chin bar goes almost all the way to the back of the helmet rather than just sitting on top. I feel that this design helps and prevents any potential wind damage. The final thing that I like about this helmet is the quick release style chin strap. Easy to manipulate one handed or with gloves on. Overall, I am impressed with this helmet and love the ability to flip it open when riding on trails or in heavy traffic.\n",

      "Hi - Just bought this (somewhere local) and I am really excited to ride with this. I have rode an hour max right now with it due to weather. The modular designed is best for me due to my girly hair extensions, and I feel less confined. This allows me to shift the heavy weight of opening it to a more equal balance. I am also excited to use it with the shield down and the chin bar back. What an amazing feature! I just wish it had BT in it - but otherwise I am loving it.\n",

As a new rider I'm not used to what a proper helmet should fit like, but I listened to the wisdom of those with experience and I'm glad I did. It feels to tight when you first put it on, but let it break in and get some sweat on it. It is great now!After 1 day of ridding, the discomfort from the pads (mostly on the checks) disappeared (pro tip, wear your helmet while doing your online MSF to break it in).I would recommend this to anyone looking for a compromise between style, price, and the most important thing, safety.\n",

      "I've owned this helmet for a full season and it's been through about 6k miles of use.It still feels like the day I first bought it, no significant wear. I have the gold-tinted face shield with the white colored shell and everything still looks almost new.During the winter I only have issues with my chin getting cold, during the summer (In GA) the helmet stays pretty cool as long as I'm moving. It's nowhere near the horror of a swampy fish-bowl that I've heard some Full Faces can be.I don't know if I'd buy another one, being a Georgia rider I'd want more airflow and less noise on the highway. I think my next step will be a Shoei RF-SR.Overall I'd recommend this to someone who wants a no-frills full face that is 1. Safe 2. Affordable 3. Will last heavy use over a couple of years.My only real complaint is that the helmet feels a bit... big. It doesn't look odd by any means, but I feel like the shell for the large is maybe 15-25% larger than some premium helmets. That's a minor gripe for me though.\n",

I also took out the wind guard under the chin and that made the helmet feel much less claustrophobic. I like that the pads are removable as I am sure I will sweat in the TN heat.

      "Earlier model was better - still good\n",
      "First off, this is a great helmet, esp. for the money. Snell counts for a lot. I bought this to replace the older-model (2016?) EXO R420, which you can still find on Revzilla as of 2019, and I actually recommend that one over the newer model and I'll tell you why below. They are nearly identical except for a few key features. Namely, the vents, the overall shape, and the visor. None of the updates are really improvements -- just different -- and the shape does look more modern but I prefer the regular \"no frills\" shape of the older model, versus the newer one, which tries to look streamlined but really just gives you an alien head and takes up more space in my topcase for no reason. And the new visor is really hard to snap down to fully closed -- older model has a nice lever on the side that is easy to check and feel if it's closed or open. The lever can also be used to \"crack\" the visor slightly -- newer one, much less adjustable.The Snell rating on both is for the same year - 2015 - so no improvement there.Quality on the older model was better all around, including the chin strap, which was both thicker and somehow easier to thread through the D-rings.The one notable exception is the inner lining. The old model has a pattern on the crown lining that creates a weird \"bumpy\" pattern on my (close-cropped) head after I take it off. Having both, I switched the inner lining and now use the older helmet with the new lining. The crown part you can switch -- the cheekpads you can't, as the newer model has these tiny goofy snaps that won't catch the older model's holes. I'll keep this one for my 2nd/backup helmet, but probably won't be buying the next model as I suspect they'll keep \"improving\" it. By then I'll be ready to upgrade to a nicer helmet anyway.\n",

      "Wind noise: Because this is huge to me, I can confidently say this helmet doesn't have any issues with \"louder than average\" wind noise.  I say this because I trialed out a Bell helmet that was of equal value and I had to return it because the wind was so noticeably loud.  Bad design I'm guessing, but Scorpion doesn't disappoint when it comes to this.Fit/comfort: I wear an XL and the fit is great.  Took a few days to break in as it felt tight but it does loosen after that first week for sure.  They make it really easy to remove the pad inserts so you can wash the material every so often.  This is key as those summer months can be brutal with sweat.Overall, I love this helmet.  I was handed down an older Scorpion helmet.  Solid helmet, but needed something new as it was getting worn out from years of prior use.  Sena SMH-10 is installed in it and love the pairing.  I will be sticking with Scorpion brand for awhile if their consistency and value remain the same.\n",

That being said, the safety rating/features on the Gringo is laughable and the large opening lets in rain when wearing goggles and is a pain/eyesore when used with a visor.So I decided to get a proper lid for cold/wet weather riding and after a couple weeks of reviewing various options on here I decided on the R420.Pros:- It doesn't let in water (big step up from my other lid)- The visor gives a good field of vision- Visor locks down with a satisfying click and can be cracked open to allow fog to clear (on the rare occasion it may occur)- Airflow is plentiful and controllable- Snell safety rating. Enough said.- Emergency removable cheek pads. I've had a serious crash in the past, so these things are a big plus.- Fit is snug without being painfully tight. The pads will break in a little so bear that in mind. Mine has gone from comfortably tight to comfortably snug.Cons:- I've noticed in the cold weather that some air does get in around the visor during high speeds, so consider a balaclava- No mounting point for bluetooth gear (not an issue for me, but may be for others)- Visor is not pinlock ready- Yes, it looks big when on. It's a helmet, with a good safety rating. Get over it.That's about it. Solid lid for ~$150 that will do all seasons, with the right planning/gear.\n",

I've personally only have two complaints: first and more importantly, the airflow is limited with the shield closed, since there are only two vents. The mouth vent actually works great, but the top vent leaves a lot to be desired. Second, and maybe this is because I have a big noggin for my slight frame (6'0'', 160, size L), but while it looks good, this thing is HUGE. I will probably hang on to this helmet for my first year of riding, but will eventually opt to trade up to something that makes me look less like a bobblehead.\n",

Also, the interior is set up to accept my Sena 20s speakers so I have radio and comms capabilities. I also bought mirrored lens which is nice on sunny days. But would not want to wear it at night. The clear is easy to swap over though. The lock on the lens locks secure and I have no problem locking and unlocking with my left or right hand. Even with gloves on. If you find it hard to locate with gloves,.. practice. If you read other reviews that say the lens lock is hard and it discouraged you. You are missing out. The worst part I have found is that I don't feel much airflow through the vents except for the coolest of nights. That's the only time I can feel the difference between open and closed. I haven't used in winter conditions yet. This is my second scorpion I also have a modular AT dual sport helmet. I liked it so much I wanted to try a street helment.

It does cut through the air much nicer then my previous helmet, I feel less stress on my neck at high speeds.  I don't feel restricted in my vision (which was something I was worried about), I can move my head very freely and the helmet feels light.The biggest downside to the helmet so far is it did fog up on me in the rain.

      "As a new rider I wanted a good helmet for a good price, did my research and ended up with this badboy! Great fit and comfortable. Only thing is it doesn’t come with two visors only a clear and the clear visor got scratched  up after the first ride which wasn’t more than 10 minutes. Great product overall.\n",

      "This was my first helmet, and if had more experience with fitting I'd have returned it as it was a bit small (my head measures 58cm so figured a large was a safe bet. I say it's small, but it actually fits really good once on.Just the cheeks press in too much and I can't talk without biting myself. Getting it off feels like I'm removing the skin from my forehead. Regardless, I still wear this on longer rides because it's comfortable (if not talking), but mostly I feel pretty damn safe with it on. Oh by the way, this helmet is HUGE. People say I look like a bobblehead.\n",

      "I absolutely love this helmet! I got a size medium with my head measuring at 57 cm and It fit my head perfectly right out the box. It's very comfortable overall. It's my first helmet and I don't regret getting this helmet at all. I also ordered this helmet with a silver mirror tinted visor which looks fantastic! The shape of the helmet is sporty and aggressive looking which will just catch peoples eyes, It's an attention-getter. If you're looking into starting to ride then this is definitely a great option for a first helmet. Everything works great and I can't not recommend this. Hope this helps! :)\n",

      "watched a video on the best budget helmets from RevZilla, and they raved about the 410.  In an updated video they said this new 420 was even better and more likely to fit most people's heads.  Between the return policy here and the GREAT price, i tried it out and they were right. A great fit, swapable visor, and track ready for $150? So nice.Oh and for people wearing glasses - i can easily take mine on and off through the helmet. I know some other helmets are way too snug around the face and you're stabbing your eyeball trying to get them on your face, but with this helmet that's not the case. I've been using modular helmets my whole time riding because i thought a solid helmet wouldn't let me easily put my glasses on - boy was i wrong.Buy this helmet with confidence!\n",

      "People have already mentioned tight cheek pads. I won't go too into that, but I will say my earplugs (SureFire EP7) fit just fine. My earbuds (MEE audio M6 pro) do not for the life me. Which is a bit frustrating. I would say the most frustrating is the snaps that keep the pads in place are flaky as hell. They pop out *quite* easily, harder than it is to line them up and pop them in. Would I recommend this? I'm not sure. It's my first motorcycle helmet. I'm 100% certain a better mechanism for attaching the pads could (or has been) devised. To its credit, the helmet's face shield mechanism has been reliable, even after the face shield popped off when I dropped it. And my glasses/sunglasses fit alright. Also, I appreciate the SNELL rating. In the end, my next helmet I'll definitely be sizing in a store and making sure my gear (re: earbuds) fits and I wouldn't pick this because of that.\n",

      "This is an amazing helmet for under $300. Only thing is it fogs up so much with little breathing that it makes it very hard to see. I mean for under $300 you expect that however it is more than you think. But just open the visor a little and the fog goes right away. Quite loud as well, but yet again only $300. Also, it doesn’t really fit too well. It’s just long in front, and I didn’t really expect that, but all in all good for the money!\n",

      "Purchased this as my first Helmet. Fit is true, I am a medium, it fit snug but not uncomfortable. Break in was quick and is more comfortable after only a few hours. I will say the interior material for the pads is obviously not super high quality but more than sufficient for a helmet in this price range. Only gripe is that the pads on the top of your head are a little thin.  I would purchase again for a replacement in this price range. I would say you get a little more than what you pay for with this one. Not sure if it is gonna vent enough in the summer heat unless your on the highway though. We will see.\n",

      "This helmet is a great value, i purchased this as a back up helmet and for use at the track since it is snell rated. i was super surprised at what this helmet has to offer. Space for Bluetooth speakers, emergency release cheek pads, and it’s pretty quite which is another big surprise. It definitely exceeded my expectations of a $150 helmet. The airflow is pretty good however the chin vent does not defrost as well as my exo T1200 helmet. In the cold when you open the vent it really hits you on the chin where my T1200 does a better job of directing air to the visor to keep it from fogging. Other then that my only complaint is that the visor can be a bit difficult to open sometimes with gloves on but you get used to finding the release tab.\n",

      "Awesome helmet for a fairly cheap price\n",
      "I recently bought this helmet in size small. My head measured at 56 cm and I decided to get it smaller to make sure the fit would be snug. I have only ridden it a handful of times since it’s getting cold in Northern Texas. The times I have ridden with it it feels amazing! Although it comes with only the clear shield I ordered the tinted one and it was delivered inside the same box. I have to say it is very comfortable and the vents flow a good amount of air that I can actually feel it hit the top of my head and through the chin vent. The anti fog shield on both the clear and the tinted one are awesome. There is very little fog that is made in around 28 F weather. The fog that is made quickly disperses when you start riding. There are cutouts on the ears for comfort and they actually fit my speakers perfectly. Overall I couldn’t have bought a better simple helmet for the money with the awesome protection it has being Snell 2015 approved. I highly recommend you buy this helmet if you’re looking for good comfort and protection at a super reasonable price compared to other helmets.\n",

I have been looking at the Mag 9 and the J-Cruise but pulled the trigger on the IS33 2 and I love it. I have never had a helmet that fit this well. Sure it is a little snug but I can tell that once broken in, just like a comfortable pair of shoes it will be one of my favorits. Moreover the install of my Sena SMA 10 was the easiest and best fit of all 6 helmets that I have done. Price is good, removable center and cheek pads.

      "This helmet is very light, very functional, and it just looks very nice, not to mention the price is right!  If I were to want any changes to this helmet, it would be how high it sits up on your head.  I understand the need for protection, but it would look even better than it already does of it was either a bit lower on your head, or the oval design was such that it made it appear to sit lower to the head.  As for the wind noise, I guess a denser material would add to the weight of the helmet, which I don't want.  After all, wind will flow under the face guard in this type of helmet which will and does undoubtedly add to the noise.  I've used full-faced helmets that were much noisier, so in comparison, this one is not bad at all.  All in all, this helmet rocks!  Not only would I buy it again, but I already have, and RevZilla is my main goto place for it!\n",

We rode in 45 degrees in Kansas, wind,  rain (put on face shield) and 90 degree heat in texas (took off face shield and put visor on several times, very easy to do once you get everything aligned). Good ventilation with shield off, seals up good with shield on (not much ventilation) I have to have it up one notch. In the terrible side wind we rode in helmet stays put, and not really any break in time, I tend to get a new helmet every other year but this one may stick around longer. I got the Matte Black and it looks sweet! Used the flip down sun shield a couple of times when the sun was blinding.

Figuring the same manufacturer and style and size I thought I could order this helmet in large and it would fit fine. It does NOT.I've had it for about 6 months but have only worn it three times. The first two for just local stuff around town but the third time for a half day ride. This was when I discovered how brutally uncomfortable it is.  It left me with a headache and dents in my forehead.This helmet is a quite different shape from other HJCs I've had and because of the length of time I've had it is non returnable and non fixable as well. It's a door stop unless I can find someone to give it to that it will fit.\n",

      "Bought one for the wife and one for me.  Hers was a medium and fit spot on.  Mine was a 2x (largest available) and fit like OJs glove at trial.  Smallest 2x I have ever tried on.  It was a shame because I love the versatility of helmet and my wife loves hers.  A couple of features that you may care about.  Super easy to put a Sena 20s on it.  The big HJC label on the front peels right off. So does the big ass warning label on the side.  Love this helmet, spot on in sizing in the Medium.  Not sure there is a difference between the XL and XXL.\n",

      "So, you can't compare a $140 helmet to an $800 helmet. But this is my 2nd HJC helmet and it is hard to beat the value. I have a more oval head, and this seems more of a rounder head fit than my last one. I had to get an XL in this one and my last was a large. It is not a particularly quiet helmet, but I wear earplugs so not a big deal. I like and use the sun shield, but usually have to push the helmet back because the sharp edge of the shield hits my nose. I would not want to face plant with the sunshield down. a very nice helmet, and I use it when I want open face, but not perfect for me.\n",

As for noise and wind with the shield the noise is very manageable for a 3/4 helmet. Obviously once you remove the shield it gets windier and louder. The pads are comfortable but strong and the speaker pocket is great.\n",

      "1. This helmet fits very snug, initially, but after a few hours of wearing it the impact foam material loosened and the fit was comfortable. This this is true for any new helmet.2. The ear cavity has large openings suitable for earplugs or mechanical ear devices.3. The helmet comes with an external sun visor. But you have to chose between attaching the sun visor or using the clear face protector. I would have liked to have seen the sun visor to be able to attach to the face protector using snaps. And having snaps on the helmet so the rider can chose which is better for them. During the morning around 10am, the integrated sun shield isn't enough to block the sun. The visor would have been a welcome addition.4. The integrated sun shield is a nice touch providing extra protection from the sun. This can get a little tight if you're wearing eyeglasses but it is manageable.5. The vision with the face protector is wide open providing 180 degrees of vision, unlike my full face helmet. This took me a while to get used to. Overall, this is a descent helmet and despite its shortcomings I'd order it again.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet to have an open-face for riding my Harley.  I can't do the $15 beanie-type helmets most of those guys wear.  I'm typically a Shoei guy, so I was a little worried about quality, although I've always had good luck with  HJC helmets.  This is basically a $100 helmet, and just as the law of economics dictate, you get what you pay for.  That said, fit and finish was better than any other low cost helmets I considered.  It was surprisingly lighter weight than expected, and much quieter too.   Without the clear windscreen attached the integrated sun visor rattles around quite loudly.  I also found it buffeted violently with the visor installed, but that might be more induced by my bike's windshield.  Riding with it truly open-face with the visor or windscreen removed it was quiet, lightweight, and comfortable.  Interior pieces seem to be good quality.Again, you get what you pay for and this helmet is no exception.  It isn't Shoei quality, but for price you can't beat it.  Certainly blows other cheap ones out of the water.\n",

      "A Competent and Pleasant Second Helmet\n",
      "I'm a practical and cautious person, so I've been talking myself OUT of open-face helmets for 20+ years, but I'm always drawn to them. My current regular lid is a Shoei Qwest and I like it just fine. I looked at the Shoei J-Cruise, but couldn't justify the price for a \"summer\" helmet. The HJC seemed like the sweet spot of price/features/protection for me. I am pleasantly surprised. It's only a little noisier than the Qwest with the Quest shield down, but it's MUCH quieter than the Qwest with its shield up. I use this helmet with the peak and sun visor configuration and I'm really enjoying the openness of it. It's not precisely a pleasurable experience at California freeway speeds, but it's not a deal-breaker either. And everywhere else under 60mph, it feels great to me.I understand the additional risk that comes with wearing an open-face helmet, and I concede that the benefits of comfort and connection might seem a lot less important AFTER an accident, but I can say that this helmet increases my enjoyment of riding, which was in the \"zealous-to-ecstatic\" range to begin with. That's not nothing.To summarize, I went for the discount version of what I thought I wanted, and I cannot imagine being happier with my selection. It doesn't always work out that way. Thanks to HJC and Revzilla.\n",

      "I bought my IS-33 II some time in June or July of last year. I had an IS-33 at the time and I thought it was pretty good especially once broken-in. Initially, after using that for about an hour and a half, I felt a lot of pressure at the front and back of my head. That disappeared once the helmet was broken-in. This second iteration of the IS-33 felt right the moment I put it on. I'm a size L and this one fits me perfectly. The face shield is quite long which gives better coverage. Removable and installation is super easy. The drop-down internal sun visor is also better. I love the ventilation of this helmet especially when I'm riding up a mountain, for example. I can actually feel the warm air being sucked away from my head and cool air coming in. The top of my head becomes really cool.The liner and cheek pads are excellent. I've only got two gripes with this lid. First, the short strap on the left side is too short. Second, it's slightly heavier than my other three-quarter, open-face helmet. Overall though, this my favorite helmet ever. It's stylish and conservative at the same time. I have the white version. I want a gloss black too.\n",

      "If you are on the fence about this helmet or the HJC FG Jet like I was then hear me out.  I tried both of them and went with the IS 33 II for one main reason.  This helmet is MUCH MUCH MUCH quieter than the FG Jet.  FG Jet was unbearable with the shield down and no ear plugs.  When the shield is up or off it's a totally different story, but when down it was brutal.  Decided to give the IS 33 II a shot even though I figured it would sound the same.  Boy was I wrong.  You can easily ride with this helmet at highway speeds with the shield down..  Don't get me wrong, my full face is quieter, but for an open face this is pretty good and will not make you deaf.  The other plus about this helmet over the FG-Jet is that it does have the dedicated speaker cut outs, so it's a little more comm friendly.  The Jet has two features going for it compared to the IS 33 II which are better/more venting and a fiberglass shell.  I held them both at the same time and they felt the same weight to me.  I wanted to like the Jet but the noise level was unacceptable with the shield down.  If that's a priority for you then go with the IS-33 II\n",

Well, yes if you use the face shield in the hope to replace the need for a full helmet.  It's unfair to compare this to a full helmet.  Instead, compare it to a 1/2 helmet at highway speeds and it's a huge step up in noise and wind control.  It's the reason for my 'quiet' rating.  But the minute you put the face shield on, you have a huge, uncomfortable amount of wind noise and even increased buffeting.  As far as fit, it's tighter than my Shoei full at the same size but it's not uncomfortable.  Also, my Shoei seems a bit more oval that does better for me.  I'm happy with my purchase, especially for the price.  I just wasn't ready to spend the extra $100+ for the Shoei.  But for those with the coin with a Shoie head, I'd go there.\n",

There's not much more to say, but if you looking for a good priced 3/4 helmet this is it. Just listen to the man in the video review and you can't go wrong\n",

Face shield does tend to fog in cold weather but cracking it open just a little solves the problem. Good view all around & being able to put glasses on with out any difficulty is a plus. Very well engineered, & drop down sun shield works well. No problem with the return & Revzilla did it in a very short time period.Will be ordering more from Revzilla. Great customer service !\n",

The interior is very comfortable, The clear visor works well in all respects and isn't to close to your nose or face when down and locks securely in the various positions and the interior sun shade also works well. Also the small peak visor fits well which I especially like and intend to use the most.

I have been riding off and on for over 40 years wearing an open face half helmets. It actually felt strange not having the wind hit my face and the face shield was totally transparent. Not feeling the wind will take awhile to become accustom to. The internal shield worked effortlessly and the multiple positions were a plus. At a light I easily slid up the face shield and repositioned it down with one hand. The temp was only 55 but I did open the vent and could immediately feel the difference. When ordering I was right at the large, X large size and went with the large. It is just a little snug but with use will stretch just enough. HJC has produced a winner with the IS33 2, and RevZilla made the purchase and delivery effortless.\n",

The fit is perfect, although I was worried because I ordered according to chart and thought a medium would be too small. I love the flip down sun shield since I do not have to carry glasses anymore. There is no distortion in shield and for some reason there seems to be a wider field of vision than my open face. Head buffing seems to be less, but I have not rode a lot yet.

      "Supposed to be Quiet?\n",
      "I'll start with the positives:1) Comfort: My head shape is slightly oval.  I had a Shark before this, and the top of my forehead would get sore after 40-ish minutes.  This helmet is one of the most comfortable helmets I've owned.2) Fit: My measurement called for an X-Large.  I ordered a Large, and if anything the Large is slightly loose.  I don't think I could fit comfortably in a Medium, but the X-Large definitely would have been too big.3) Noise: I was told this is a quiet helmet.  It is... when I'm standing still.  I cannot notice any difference with wind noise in this helmet as any other I've owned.4) Front Lower Vent: When you open the front vent at anything above 40 m.p.h., the air blows directly at your eyes and dries them out.  Is this intended?  It's so direct, it would have to be either intended, or SERIOUS neglect!5) Face Shield: I haven't used the insert yet.  I have to re-read the instructions.  I think I remember seeing something about not using it at night?  The thing is, the face shield fogs more than any other helmet I've ever owned.  As soon as the temperature drops below 60 degrees (F), the shield will fog.  Is the insert supposed to fix that?  Again, I have to re-read the instructions about that.6) Communicator: I will review the communicator separately.  Let's just say here that it's a shame you really don't get a choice which communicator to use with this helmet.Conclusion: While this helmet is super-comfortable, it is NOT worth $699 in any way.  I have an older HJC that is just as comfortable (the Shark was horrible) and that was around $300 then, maybe $400-ish now for a comparable HJC model.  I would not recommend wasting $699 on this helmet for any of the features it boasts to justify the price.\n",

      "So, I have a huge problem with full face helmets. My brain says wear one, they are the safest, your jaw loves you too - but my helmet-claustrophobia says that putting that full lid over my head immediately gives me an anxiety attack that is less than ideal when setting off to ride - a compromise had to be made - I am sure I can handle a modular, right?I researched the **** out of every modular helmet sold anywhere, with price not being an issue, because, well, my head is rather dear to me and I'd like to keep it in the best condition that I can. I decided to go with this one over the top-end ARAI because of how much my wife raves about the performance of her Shoei GT Air here in the heat and humidity of Florida - she just loves it.First impression, it's pretty, feels relatively light, and the materials seem polished and sturdy. OK, big test next - can I handle putting it on ... yes, wears just like a 3/4 to start with, so no crazy-lady freak out that this thing is gonna be stuck on my head forever ... helmet-clausterophobia you're not the boss of me! Even pulling the chin bar down didn't freak me out, because I knew I could push it right back out of the way with one gloved hand whenever I'm pulled over or stopped at a long light.So, on the bike ... LOVE it, easy breezy - amazing airflow especiallly when it's virgin voyage was on a 90+ degree day with over 80% humidity. My ride tops out at about 55mph (Honda Monkey) but even in the 30s this thing flows a TON of air and isn't whistling or making any weird distracting noises as it flows. Not as much of a viewing window as the visor on my 3/4 but plenty to see around. I don't really have a comparison, so I'd say that the range of view is pretty darn good.If you're on the fence about a full-face (for whatever reason), and you, like me, realise a 3/4 really doesn't cut it safety-wise, then this is the helmet to get! 5 well deserved stars to Shoei :)\n",

      "I was nervous to spend a grand for the Neotec II and Sena SRL.  Previously, I was using a Sedici Sistema with Sena Evo 20 for $400.  While the Neotec II is an improvement in terms of lessened wind noise, I expected more. I will often leave the vents closed for a quieter ride. On trips that will take me longer than 10 minutes on the highway, I will still use earplugs. The pin lock feature is great about keeping my face shield fog free. The problem is it's only for daytime use.  With such a pain to put in and take out, it is more trouble than it's worth. I may end up buying a second face shield and keep the pin lock in one and swap face shields. The extra reflections and glare at night with pin lock gets to be too much.  At the end of it all, I am happy with the purchase. I'd make it again. Manage your expectations with noise and pin lock convenience.  The biggest plus for me is I can actually carry on a cell phone conversation at highway speeds whereas before, it was impossible.\n",

Fit is as expected. Solid and smooth chin bar mechanism. Drop down visor work well. Easy installation of the Sena communication system. Liner is comfortable. Good visibility with reasonably wide visor.. reasonably quiet. Chin vent flows plenty of air to keep visor from fogging and Pinlock works well.Things that could use some improvement:Top vent doesn’t seem to move as much air as expected. Visor ratchet doesn’t allow much option in keeping a small opening.in visor particularly while driving slowly in town. Visor is more difficult to change than on my Schuberth C4. The helmet control buttons on the Sena are poorly sized and hard to work with gloves on. The helmet is heavy although is balanced well over a long ride the weight was noticeable. Why put in a drop down sun visor? It adds weight and other companies are now using photo sensitive shield. Overall, I liked the helmet but I would probably go back to Schuberth for my next modular.\n",

      "I've worn Shoei helmets for the last 20 years and was very satisfied. But this helmet falls a little short. My first problem was with the plate that hold the chin curtain. The plate would come off when I would pull the helmet down and the chin curtain would fall out. My fix was to hot glue the chin curtain to the plate and then use a small amount of hot glue to hold the plate in place. Shabby, considering that this is a premium helmet. Next problem is the face shield. All of my other Shoei helmets allowed me to crack open the face shield about 1/4 of an inch to allow air flow. Not this helmet. If you open the face shield to the first notch it is in your line of sight. I have ti wonder who they tested this helmet on. I'm still a Shoei fan because of the fit but I'm sorry I made this investment.\n",

It may be due to the gap where the cover meets the body of the helmet, but also possibly the control for the visor. I'm guessing this is just an issue with modular helmets in general, since other reviews rate the noise level as quiet to normal. If that is the case, I'd forgo the modular feature in a heartbeat to have a quieter helmet. Seriously--above 40 MPH you will not be able to hear anything else. I never felt like I needed ear protection while commuting before, but with this helmet I'm thinking that ear plugs would be a good idea.Other than that, the helmet seems very well made, the field of vision is very good, the fit is very comfortable and airflow is relatively good.\n",

It has cutouts for the Sena built for this helmet but I was able to get the Uclear hbc200 speakers to fit enough that they dont put pressure on my face. Really good airflow and vision in this helmet. Yes this helmet is expensive but when you factor the extra cost over 5 years, its worth it for the comfort. The Matte Blue looks incredible and I get alot of compliments on its looks. Only minor grip is the rachet strap. It can be a little snug if you have a big neck so you can only go in 2 clicks but its still secure.\n",

      "I really wanted to love this helmet.  I've been wearing Shoei helmets for nearly 30 years and they have all fit me great.  This one was no exception.Anyone buying this helmet is going to be interested in the communication system, so when I shell out this much money I've got high expectations.  Unfortunately, the electronics is a nightmare....- installation went ok.  Followed the youtube video for a clean professional looking install.  After a few rides, the electronics started to separate from the helmet liner.  Not a big deal, I guess, but why don't they sell the electronics factory installed?- the buttons on the side of the helmet are pretty much useless, except for turning it on and off.  When I try to use them for anything else (like volume), I very often end up turning the whole system off, which is very frustrating.- fortunately, you don't have to use the buttons much as you can use voice commands instead.  Very handy, when they work...  Most of the time now, the system does not respond no matter how many times I say (or yell) \"Hello Sena\".  It frustrates me so much, that it sometimes ruins the whole vibe of my ride.I would definitely not buy this helmet again.\n",

      "I'm coming off of 5 years with a Schuberth C3 Pro so it was between the Neotec 2, a Schuberth C4 Pro or another C3 Pro. I weighed a lot of pros and cons and decided to go for it with Shoei. I'm a Large in Schuberth and a Medium in Shoei, FYI.#1, the Neotec 2 is very, very comfortable. It's super easy to slide on and off, my ears have nice little pockets to live in, the aerodynamics seem very good. The built in sun visor is very good quality. It has a slight rose tint to it compared to the neutral grey of the C3 Pro. I actually like the bit of tint. The world looks just a shade rosier. Airflow is better than the C3 Pro but, since I rate the airflow on the C3 Pro as pretty bad, I was hoping for a bit more on the Neotec. The top vent brings in a good amount of air but with the mouth vent, it's kind of hard to tell the difference between open and closed. Regardless, it's comfortable and I can breathe easily. The chin strap is easy to work with as are all the other controls (latch and sunvisor slider).The shell is bigger than the C3 Pro. The Neotec fits in my top case (BMW) but will not fit in my side cases. My C3 Pro fit everywhere. The Neotec is a bit louder than the C3 Pro. All helmets are loud at 85 mph but the difference is noticeable. I've had to up my earplug game a little. Visibility is not quite as good as Schuberth. Schuberth has a much wider visor top to bottom. With the Shoei, I have to dip my head down to see my dash or phone. Also, although the pin lock lens attaches to the edges of the visor, it will obstruct your vision if you pop the visor open only part way. Not a big deal but it's worth being aware of.The Sena SRL has its ups and downs. The down being sound quality - it's not quite loud enough to battle against wind noise and there's not much bass. The other down is the controls are very hard to hit right with gloves. The ups are it installs cleanly, pairs well with other Senas, connects to all my bluetooth devices easily and has a decent iPhone app to control settings. Bottom line is this: It is an ultra-premium helmet at an ultra-premium price that isn't perfect - nothing is - but it's close enough to be my helmet for the next 5 years.\n",

      "I bought this helmet from Revzilla not long after they were launched. I’ve previously worn Arai helmets and I do think they have a better fit in regards to head shape. This is ever so slightly big but not so big I could go a size down however I don’t regret wearing this in the least. Fit did get better after wearing it for a month or so. I love the modularity, the micro ratchet chin snap and looks of the helmet. I do find there’s less sideward visibility side to side, which is more noticeable with the pinlock in place but I don’t think it causes any danger, just something to be aware of. The airflow is great as long as your helmet is in the airstream. I’ve had personal friends and have seen others comment they didn’t think the airflow was good yet their sitting behind the windscreen on the bike. My experience shows if your in the wind stream, the airflow is fantastic. I also have the SENA SRL which isn’t the point of this review but I bought the helmet for the integrated headset capabilities. I have come to dislike being locked into one headset.I recently had a get off and the helmet performed well and kept me protected. The micro strap didn’t loosen, the modular part stayed latched solid but the mechanism still works just fine post accident. I would have no issue buying this helmet again.\n",

      "Regret buying this helmet\n",
      "I 100% regret buying this helmet and would return it in a heartbeat if I was still able to. I originally tried this helmet on in stores and was surprised at the comfort of it, so when I saved up the cash for it, I purchased it here through Revzilla. I was lucky enough to score a \"Demo\" helmet from the warehouse that was in \"Good Condition\" with only a scratch on the visor outside of the field of vision; figuring that nothing else was wrong with it, I pulled the trigger. It shipped and arrived with no issues, but when I open the helmet box, I was shocked to see that there was just the helmet there, no helmet bag, no additional padding, NOTHING. The helmet was shipped unprotected and rolling around in the box! The few spots on the helmet were now dull and had swirl marks on them as well as a few small rub points on the shield that when worn make it look like the shield was dirt. The Shoei sticker in the back was deformed and cut and it was coming off of the helmet. I am very highly disappointed in Revzilla for shipping the helmet in this condition and makes me rethink shopping with them in the future. I know it was a warehouse, but still, they should treat their items better than this; I should have returned it at this point, but I figured I could just get a new shield and be okay.So, I went to order the replacement shield and was blown away by the selection of color option; I have my pick of any shield color in the spectrum, as long as it was clear... There are no other options, just clear. If I want to order overseas, I could possibly get a tinted one, but that is just a pain. Also, the shields are quite costly.The next issue is the communicator. This helmet will work with any communicator available on the market today as long as the communicator is the Sena SRL. I have the 20s that I wanted to mount, but the proprietary SRL mount area gets in the way and forces you to put the mount further back on the helmet in an awkward area. If you are able to get it mounted, you will see that the 20s speakers do not fit in the speaker holes provided as they are slightly too big. Well, why not just by the Sena SRL? Good question! 1. It is $300 and I already have a perfectly good communicator that I bought to move from helmet to helmet. 2. The range is terrible on them, way less than the 20s. 3. Sound quality and volume are terrible, overly tinny, no bass, and hard to hear at highway speeds with earplugs. 4. Difficult to pair with other Senas. 5. Difficult to use while wearing gloves, especially cold weather gloves. 6. Can not be charged when using. 7. It will only work with the Neotec 2 helmet. If I was aware I would be unable to mount my 20s, it would have been returned immediately.Noise levels and weight. I came from (and am now still using) an N91 helmet. The Neotec is slightly heavier and slightly louder than the N91, which was quite surprising, but not a deal breaker.There are a few good things about the helmet. 1. Quality seems decent. 2. It is quite comfortable even when wearing prescription glasses. 3. It has nice cooling vents that are functional. 4. It looks pretty decent.With the flaws, I could not recommend this helmet to anyone who wants to use a better quality aftermarket communicator. Sadly, I am stuck with this helmet even though it has not been used and will be shopping for another one that is more user-friendly. Very disappointed in Revzilla for treating this helmet so poorly in the shipping process which led to additional damage to the helmet. Be wary of buying warehouse items!\n",

      "Neotec 2: Good for the Next Five Years\n",
      "Twelve years had gone by in what seemed to be an instant, and it was far past time to swap out my Shoei Multitec for a new lid.  According to most of the online \"experts,\" I was really about seven years late.  There are good reasons for the five year thing, but they're another story.I shopped all the major brands through Revzilla and other sites, but I really liked my Multitec, so I leaned to Shoei as a replacement.  As it has turned out, I made a good choice.After using it for nearly a year, I have found the Neotec 2 is the most comfortable helmet I have owned and just what I needed.  I bought a size L, because my Multitec was that size, and it is a perfect fit for my rather large noggin.  It has plenty of air flow, which is important for those of us who do most of their riding in the U.S. Southwest, an excellent visual field and is pretty nice looking.  It is also pretty quiet, but I wear ear plugs (and so should you) and have a windshield.  I'm a sport touring rider, do most of my riding on pavement, and am totally spoiled for modular helmets.  I was afraid the Neotec 2 would seem heavy, but, while I know it's there, the weight is not uncomfortable. My greatest complaint is that I could do without the internal sun tinted visor on this or any helmet.  This complaint is not specific to the Neotec 2, because, unfortunately, it is hard to find a decent modular helmet without the feature.  Such devices not only add weight, expense and complexity, but on sunny days, which are the days most of us usually ride, you have to bother with swapping your regular glasses back and forth with your sun glasses when you don and doff the helmet.  The manufacturer aptly warns against wearing sunglasses with the sun visor deployed.  Without a dark tinted sun visor, one only has to deal with sunglasses during the day and regular glasses when the sun goes down.One other little bother is that the main face shield needs one more holding notch that leaves just a little opening at the bottom like my old Multitec.  As it is, the lowest notch is a bit too high to suit me on the Neotec 2. The price didn't bother me...much...at all.  Sure I like to save money, but I had held on to the old model for so long that I might have bought two others in the interim.  By itself, that fact saved hundreds.  Besides that, I am willing to pay for the comfort, durability, ease of use and, well, I just like high quality gear.  In five years, I'll be looking at Shoei again.\n",

Holding the helmet is a different story altogether... It's exceptionally well constructed and featured. Also purchased the Sena SRL comm unit for it.Contacted Shoei via email and haven't even received a reply. Don't really know where this leaves me as Shoei has been my go-to lid for the past decade, and the original Neotec served ideally for 7 years. Time to find a helmet store. Shoei changed...

      "Preordered Mar. 2018 and got it in April. A couple of weeks later went on a 2000 mile trip. Helmet is very nicely made and really like the looks. The only complaint I had was after a few hours started really hurting just forward of my ears because it was so snug. Opening the chin bar really helped but due to the cold temps that was not a option. Thought that it would loosen up as it broke in but it never did. On returning home I ordered the thinner cheek pads and that took care of the problem. As for air flow with my windshield down low I got plenty of ventilation from the top and chin vents, but did notice if I raised the shield on the helmet it blocked the air entering the top vent. With the shield down I could actually feel the air on the top of my head which was a first for me with a modular helmet. On the return trip we rode in some really hard rain ( I mean it would drown a frog).With the shield down and vents closed my head stayed completely dry and the Pin Lock worked like a dream, no fogging at all. This is the first high dollar helmet I’ve purchased and over all I am very pleased with it. Thinking of buying one for my wife also now.Now if Sena will put the 30k guts in the SLR I’ll get that and hang up my 20S’s.\n",

      "I was in heaven with my old Shuberth C3-Pro but wore it out.  Then the C4 came out and I couldn't believe what a step back it was.    I have had great experience with the Shoei RF-1200 --arguably the best all-around non-modular helmet-- but I was not in love with the Neotech (Shoei's prior modular offering).   But alas, Shoei comes out with the Neotech 2 and I'll give it a shot.This is a very solid and no-nonsense helmet that will not disappoint.   In my mind Shoei hit a triple on this one --maybe no a home run because there are a few nits but nothing that will cause you regret in your purchase.The waterproofing and windproofing are excellent.  Visibility very good, ventilation above average.  The interior is plush and comfortable and there is nothing to irritate you.  By the way, if you're riding along and you think it's noisy, you might have the shield not quite fully closed.  There is a neat feature where it can stay about 90% closed but allow for a bit of air.  If you want it sealed just push down until you hear the 'click.' The integrated comm system is very good.  The speakers and microphone install easily and work well.  I can hear music and phone calls well.  Because there is a lot of room front to back in this helmet, the boom microphone on the front has plenty of room and doesn't get smashed against your lips.  There are a few minor gotchas in my mind, but you can live with them.   1.  It's a tad heavier than I would ideally like to see, and the shell is a bit larger than ideal for size M.  I can however barely fit it into the hard side luggage of a BMW bike.2.  There is no removable battery to swap in on a longer road trip, or recharge separately-- you have to take the entire helmet to an outlet and plug it in.3.   It's entirely subjective, but I think the style of the shell is a tad bit basic / plain.   But that suits the theme of this helmet in my mind: very solid choice, nothing wrong, nothing especially delightful...just regular.4.  They went with Sena instead of Cardo so a couple of times, I'm riding along listening to music and somehow the voice activated app thinks that the song lyrics are telling it to call someone in my contacts list.   So imagine the embarrassment when I have to say, uh, sorry, my helmet dialed you accidentally.    I may have to disable the VOX (voice command).\n",

Didn't buy it here but as the reviews here are super helpful I thought I'd give back to the community.Overall I'm super happy with the Neotech.  I take a Medium i the Hornet but had to go to a small for this helmet.   Snug, but the right size.  I wanted to a helmet to solve a few issues I was having with the Hornet.  Fogging, Buffeting, Noise, Warmth, Not wearing sunglasses, and regular stops.Fogging - in winter, with a full face balaclava and visor down, there is no fogging at all.  The internal sun visor fogged slightly but that will be because it doesn't have a Pinlock fitted.  With the chin air vent open, I don't get cold air on my face, but it's obviously letting air enter.Buffeting - Hornet has a sun peak which buffets over 80kmh.  Now there's no buffeting at any speed and when you turn your head sideways at speed, you don't get your neck spun aroundNoise.  It's much quieter than my Hornet - much.  That being said, I knew I wanted a quiet helmet - and maybe in my mind I was expecting an experience akin to the first time you put on noise cancelling headphones. That being said, here in Italy, using earplugs whilst riding causes any insurance claim to be nullified, so I don't use those anymore.Warmth.  The closed design of the neck padding stops air getting in from underneath - this has a massive benefit on keeping you warm and reducing noise.  We'll see how that works out in summer, but for winter riding it's made the need for a full face balaclava redundant.Sunglasses.  I wear contacts mostly when riding and the internal sun visor means I don't have to mess around with sunglasses.  Especially helpful here in northern Italy where a ride in the hills means going in and out of tunnels very frequently.  Can't help but wish the visor was slightly darker - but it's crystal clear.Flip-Up Practicality.  This is my first flip-up modular helmet and as I use the bike every day, it's a big help to not have to take off the helmet for gas stops, running into stores etc.  So far so good.\n",

Lidpicker reflects this accurately as well, not sure where RZ concluded this is one of Shoei's more neutral.My head is VERY long oval. I have an RF-1200 size XL which fits fore to aft well but not side to side (too much space). A size L X-14 fits ONLY with the front and rear liner pads swapped to the super thin ones and it is still snug fore to aft while side to side there is room. A gt-air size XL is TOO TIGHT fore to aft on my 59 cm head (told you, very long oval).Neotec 2, size L, perfect fit fore to aft, negligible room side to side. It is quite long oval. The helmet itself is really a solid product. A little heavy, pretty bulky shell (especially down around the jaw), but it is clearly designed towards a purpose and it excels at that purpose. It is very quiet, comfortable, and aerodynamic. Upright buffeting is nonexistent.My only gripes would be I wish the visor went down a cm more or so, and the chin seems like it could be narrowed a bit to hide the size, but that is pretty minor.

      "For reference. I ride a R1200GS LC Adventure and I'm 1.80m and 80Kg. I'm a 4 season (Sea Climate) rider living in the Netherlands, so lots of rain. On average i ride 30.000 a year.I had the NeoTec 1 for 4 years and upgraded to the NeoTec 2 due to the wear and tear on it after 120.000 Km (still looked and worked good though). I looked at the Schuberth C4 but the front liner pushed to much on my eyebrows… so no go.The comfort on the NeoTec 2 is still the same with the exception that with the older NeoTec I had a size S and the 2 is M. No pressure points whatsoever. The noise level seems to be a bit lower than the 1  due to the intergrated intercom. I previously used a Sena 20s. Ventilation is the same alltough is mis the edge on te the top vent. The front vent seems more sturdy build than on the old NeoTec. I managed to break and crack that on the old one which was replaced under warranty.Most of the time, when weather lets me, i ride with the front open. Since the 2 is certified for both full and open operation this is a nice bonus. Visibility is the same like the old NeoTec so no complaints in that department.Design wise the 2 looks a little less bulky than the 1. Also the higher weight of the 2 is something I did not feel when riding.If there is something negativ to say about the 2? Well not really, it does what is should do and with comfort, it really does. Thats perhaps a negativ thing too when is does everything so well and you are complaining that you don't have anything to complain about. The only thing that bugs me a bit when riding is that I liked the dial operation on my old Sena 20s wich are now push buttons due to the intergration. Now... for something completely different that has nothing to do with this specific helmet. After a broken front vent and a cracked sunvisor hinge on my NeoTec 1 I sent it to Shoei. Got it back repaired and fully serviced. A nice letter was included stating that the crack was due to the use of a much to corrosive cleaing agent. I can confirm that I was at fault here and  still they repaired it under warranty (5 years). That is what I call service.\n",

      "Last helmet was a GT Air. before that an Arai. This helmet has the most features, love the built in com, drop down shade, ratchet latch (which I love and first thought was just a gimmick). but, it is noisy! I found however, if you shrug your shoulders which blocks air, the noise drops TREMENDOUSLY. I'm thinking maybe my helmet too large? however, I know how to fit a helmet, and this is a good fit. I may try to improvise some foam to block that air. whatever comes of that, I would buy this again. Just to show you different people have different opinions, experiences, I don't think the air flow is anything to crow about, but its ok. the ability to flip the chin guard up and ease of using the shade and ratchet strap make it worth the money. I would suggest taking it for a ride to check the noise level first.\n",

      "...when something costs near $700, I expect better. To be fair, let's start with the pros: somewhat lighter and quieter than my 8 year old Neotec, with greatly improved airflow. Still need to ride with earplugs, but that's just me wanting to save what's left of my hearing.Cons: in the XL size, even with a narrow face, the stock cheek pads are too tight. The 31s are much more comfortable. With a narrow jaw the chin strap has to be let out completely and is still fairly snug. The opening at the chin is really narrow and causes discomfort in the jaw even on short rides; maybe I'll get used to it. No offense to Revzilla, but if you plan to spend this kind of money, I'd shop closer to home. As always, YMMV.\n",

      "Bought the Neotec 2 as a secondary helmet to my RF-1200. Without wasting anyone's time with the well-hashed specs about the helmet, let me summarize it in comparison to the RF-1200 for anyone out there thinking about making a similar leap from full-face to modular:About me: 6'1\", Versys 1000, Puig windscreen (a little taller and wider than stock screen) and I tend to sit quite upright.The wind moves just over the top of my head with the screen all the way up in \"touring mode\".Compared to the RF-1200:1. I don't notice any weight difference at all although the Neotec comes in at .62 pounds heavier (per Revzilla product page).2: Quieter and less buffeting. I wear hearing protection but I can still tell that the Neotec 2 is a bit quieter than the RF-1200. My head is definitely more stable at freeway speeds (i.e. 85mph) than the RF-1200 with my screen/seating arrangement. Shoulder checks at freeway speeds are also more smooth with the Neotec. 3. Hotter/less airflow. There has to be a cost for the increased silence and that is more heat inside the helmet. The lower padding does a great job of enveloping my throat and neck to reduce noise but it does make it toasty inside the helmet when moving slowly (< 25mph) at temps above 80 degrees. The airflow through the vents isn't quite as good as the RF-1200. That being said, at highway speeds the heat isn't a problem at all. I'm hoping it will be very comfy during the cooler months.I immediately put 31mm cheekpads in my Neotec, just like the RF-1200. I have resigned to the fact that any time I buy a Shoei I will need to include the cheekpad cost with the helmet.Final word: I really like the Neotec 2! In fact I haven't used my RF-1200 since I got the Neotec two weeks ago although I plan on using the RF-1200 for shorter, around-town jaunts.\n",

      "Disclaimer: I own Schubert’s C3 and C3 Pro helmets, so my review is more of a comparison.1. Air Flow. There’s almost nothing air coming through the chin vent, and very little - through the top vent, and what air does get in - it doesn’t really cool your head, since the air outlet is also on top, so what little air manages to get in gets immediately exhausted through the outlet vent. Compared to Schubert’s, I’d say Neotec 2 gets about 5-10% of air flow compared to Schuberth. 2. Noise. The helmet has a lot of protrusions on the outer shell, so as you ride - they produce A LOT of noise: whistling, humming, whooshing - you name it! I didn’t feel a whole lot of difference with regular (non-low noise) helmets. Got a headache after wearing it for about an hour.3. This helmet is MASSIVE compared to Schuberth. It’s about 1 inch wider than Schuberth and looks huge.4. Face opening. The upper edge of the opening sits very low and obstructs the view above.5. Faceshield material is much harder and is much more difficult to scratch, compared to Schuberth’s, which is made from softer plastic and is scratched very easily. At least something positive ??6. Faceshield is very difficult to remove and put back on, compared to Schuberth.7. There is no choice of faceshields. There’s only one: clear faceshield, versus Schuberth’s choice of more than 5 different types.Overall, I think that for the same price, I’d prefer Schuberth: quieter, smaller, better air flow.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet last week. Right from the first time I put it on it felt as comfortable as could be.  The only issue I had was with the chin guard.  It was rubbing on the lower part of my chin. I also felt during the hot summer months is was restricting the air flow. I removed the chin guard which was very easy,  Now the helmet fits perfect, lets enough additional air through for the hot summer months.  I also added the SRl com system. I use the firewire with my Goldwing and the com system works perfect. Plenty of volume, very clear. Even the music sounds good. I couldn't be happier with this helmet. It is a pricey investment, but in my opinion and for my application it is well worth the investment.\n",

Out of the box, it looked great but then I found what I considered deal breaking faults.The first  was the fact that the chinstrap protection padding was too narrow meaning that the actual chinstrap cut into my chin. The second problem was the padding at the front of the helmet. It was almost nonexistent which meant my forehead rested against the front of the helmet causing pain.Given the expense of the helmet, I was not about to ride with an uncomfortable helmet so I sent it back and bought a Schuberth C3 Pro that has been great.\n",

      "After 15 years of repping Arai and looking to replace my Defiant, on the advice of a Revzilla Gear Geek, I decided it was time to revisit my non-relationship with Shoei. I had tried an RF-1100 and Qwest and instantly disliked them both, so wrote off the line as not suitable for my mutant melon (that Arai vs Shoei thing, you know).Having been burned in the past by buying poor fitting lids online (sorry, ZLA, not your fault!), I went to my local gear shop to try on a 1200 and J-Cruise. I hadn't planned on going modular until the salesguy suggested the Neotec 2. I shrugged and said \"Eh, why not.\" I pulled it on, settled it down and got familiar with the features, then realized that I've finally found The One. Not saying it's perfect, but wow. Soooo plush and comfortable, great fit for my not-really-intermediate-but-not-long-either headbone, amazingly quiet even with the shield up. On the road, with everything closed and my earplugs in, I have almost no wind noise. Just the rumble of the bike and subdued whoosh of cages.I have two minor gripes about the Neo2: first, I feel no ventilation over my shaven dome with the intake vent open. Since I've never felt it with any other helmet either, this is kind of moot. Second, I had a fairly annoying forehead hotspot about 30 minutes into my first ride, and 60 minutes into my second. However, I'm right between the small and medium at 56.5cm, so I had gone with the small to allow for break-in. After a bit of, uh, modification to a raised area of the EPS, it's flawless.The chinbar quietly snicks into place with zero effort and doesn't move so much as .1mm after that. The sunshade moves up and down with perfect smoothness. The outer shield is seriously beefy, sealing tight and holding the ratchet points at any speed. The pinlock insert and breath guard are very thoughtful in-the-box extras, although unneeded here in Mordor, er, Phoenix.Normally after paying this much for any bit of gear, buyer's remorse tends to set in. 200 miles into my Neo2, nope.

Two things I've found: I'm normally a Shoei large size, but with this helmet, I had to get the thicker checkpads as the standard ones after a while let the helmet move around too much. (first time ever for a Shoei for me).Second: I have a Sena 20s and really liked it, but it was a bit of a frankenstein setup to get it to work with the Neotec2. Have decided to spend the extra and go the proper integrated unit.  Just annoys me that I spent money on the 20s, but can't use it on a helmet that cost me $1k. Would I recommend it ?

The SRL works really well - better than my 20s did.  Voice Commands work every time, so I'm happy about that.  So here's the thing - this helmet seems louder than my previous Shoe GT-Air helmet which the Neotec 2 is replacing.  Somehow when facing straight ahead, sitting behind my screen on my s1000xr, I get a lot of wind whistling turbulence sounds.  If I turn my head left or right - nothing. Straight ahead - turbulence.  It doesn't seem to be a leaky visor - pressing all around the edges at 60+ mph made no difference.  Doesn't seem to be wind blowing up under the chin bar because when I block this area the turbulence sound remains unchanged.  So I'm assuming it is coming in through the sides where the modular seem is for the chin bar.  Having said this, I can ride without ear plugs which I couldn't do with any previous helmets.  For short highway rides I'll go without ear plugs.  For all day slabbing I would definitely wear plugs.  Maybe others will better identify where the wind turbulence sounds are being created, but if those could be reduced this helmet/coms combo would be perfect.  The weight while wearing is no problem - seems to be held by the air currents.  Love the ratchet chin strap - one hand on and off.  Overall quality and fit is top shelf.\n",

      "How can a $700 helmet be worth it? IT IS!\n",
      "Okay, so I am one of those people who every year, I realize how uncomfortable my helmet is, I have a scratch on it, and its aging, so I buy a new sub $200 helmet on sale and feel good about myself for a day, only to replace it next season.Well I was tired of saving on budget helmets so I purchased this today. The ride home was incredible! First off, I ride a Harley with apes so aerodynamics is important. At 110mph (allegedly/ closed course / professional driver) it performed flawlessly. Especially for its bulkiness. The airflow was great, the front vent feels like an a/c vent in a car on medium low. Just a nice, slight breeze.I believe this is just like the GT Air but modular, designed for upright riding, and it fits the bill. I was always anti-modular helmets, but these latches are ridiculously sturdy and I trust it... with my life... Its hard to justify such a big expense on a helmet. But it is the most comfortable helmet I've ever worn.I compared it directly to an RF1200, GT-Air, Neotec 1, and a built technico (or whatever). This fit all the features, it was comfortable, and worth every dime. Previous helmets are Scorpion EXOs, Speed & Strength, etc...\n",

      "So far, so good\n",
      "I received my Neotec II earlier today and immediately found it to be everything my original Neotec was, but better. First, the one thing I am on the fence about. The only thing about the fit that I am marginally less thrilled about is that the strap seems to be located a little back of where my old helmet strap is. It is very possible that it will “move” slightly as the helmet breaks in. Having said that, it is not a deal-breaker and the new ratchet buckle is an absolute plus. Everything else is what the original Neotec was,  but better. It is far quieter, has better mechanical engagements, and fits perfectly. I can’t say too much about ventilation or hot weather cooling yet, but if it improves upon the original, it can only be fantastic.  I wish Shoei would make a carbon fiber version to shave some of the weight, but for a modular helmet it is certainly not “heavy.” I plan to install the SENA communication unit when it becomes available and will update this review after I log some more miles. The bottom line is that this helmet lives up to its legacy very well.\n",

      "Finally, a modular with some oomph.\n",
      "I must say, this helmet is extraordinary.  The fit and finish are amazing, comfortable, new ratchet strap is right on, and the Sena SLR fits perfect.  The helmet is very quiet and airflow is excellent.  The new visor is thick and very sturdy. The negatives are not many, but the fixed chin curtain I wish was more like the XD4 where you could move it, and be leather vs liner material.  The helmet is a bit heavier than my rf1200, but much less than my old Shark modular.  The visor also comes with a pinlock which is superb, but the visor is more difficult to take off than my rf1200.  The latch mechanism then closing the modular is getting annoying.  It takes effort to latch it on both sides, I am hoping this eases with use.  But overall, it’s a great helmet, and I plan to be riding with it for a very long time.  Highly recommend.  And to compare to the Schubert’s E1, C3 and C4Pro?  Get the Shoei, hands down crushes the competition.\n",

      "Not the perfect helmet, but really close\n",
      "I had high hopes for this helmet. I'm getting away from a Schuberth C3, which I love, but it hurts my head...not quite the right shape for me. The Neotec 2 fits me perfectly, I mean it's very comfortable. It has many of the same features that the Schuberth has, but it's not nearly as quiet as the Schuberth. I'm disappointed about this. The neck roll seals down below, so there's no air coming in through there, If I put my finger covering the top vent, the helmet becomes silent. So, it appears to be the top vent that's causing all of the noise. It makes the same noise whether the vent is open or closed. If I tilt my head down in a more sport bike position, the noise lessens. If I sit up straight, it gets pretty loud. I'd love for someone to make a removable plug for that vent to make the helmet silent. I realize that I couldn't use the vent with a plug in there, but on most rides, that's probably fine. Again, I had high hopes for this helmet. My only issue is the noise compared to my super silent Schuberth C3 Pro.\n",

      "Just got this in the Matt deep gray. Beautiful color. Had to get from Italy for upcoming cross country trip (USA) as they’re not released stateside for another month or so. Sorry Revzilla, usually purchase from you guys. I prefer the neotec 2 styling over the comparable C4 which was my second choice.Typical Shoei quality, usually wear a L and ordered a L, it fits like it was specially made for my head and weighs in at 1665 g.Virtually no break in time required for me, inner linings are super plush and ratchet strap closure is high quality and easy to operate with gloved hand(s).Drop down sun visor, main visor and chin bar all operate smoothly but with a firm quality that reminds you that this helmet is worth the investment every time you raise or lower one of them. Included pinlock is superb. Visor removal and installation is quite literally a snap! Field of vision is excellent. Venting is great IMO. Top vent is touted as being 3 position, open, half way and closed, in reality, for me at least it’s more like 2 position, open or closed as there is no real mid point detent to feel for with gloved hand. No biggie. Front vent flows a ton of air, right up the front of your face, especially with included breath guard fitted, its two position, open or closed. Venting with chin bar raised is phenomenal !! Noise level inside lid obviously increases with vents open but not by much, for a modular, this thing is pretty quiet. Haven’t removed any of the inner liners yet, will be doing so in the next couple of weeks to fit the Sena SRL, not yet purchased, wanted to make sure I liked the lid first, but don’t envision any problems given the apparent quality of everything else about this helmet. I’ve been wearing motorcycle helmets for 30 years, mostly Aral and Shoei and can honestly say this one is a thing of beauty and more importantly really, just works very well. Dual homologation too.If you hadn’t figured it out yet,  I love this helmet and highly recommend.\n",

Right out of the box, I could tell the hinge mechanism is beefier. The fit and finish is excellent. Fitting my SENA was a piece of cake. It doesn’t come with a chin curtain, so I ordered a set (there’s a summer and winter version). Took it for a 160 mile ride last weekend and I’m very happy with my choice. It’s noticeably quieter and very comfy for a long ride. This morning I went for another ride and my pillion said I sounded clearer over the intercom.

This helmet gives me the best of both worlds. I do appreciate the flip down sun visor built into the helmet another great feature that either wasn't available 20 years ago, or I was so broke I couldn't afford what it might have cost at the time.

It’s been hot here, 90+, and I’ve not been burning up. Airflow is pretty decent. It’s a tad heavy, but it could just be the size of helmet that I need.  All features work with one hand, so its great for on the move.

Overall it's a great helmet and I'm happy with it. I took a star off because they run small, even with proper measurements done as per the instructions and chart on this website. For my measurement it said I needed a large even though my 13 year old helmet was XL. I went with the large and found it way too small. I then shipped it back and got the XL. I found this to be small but not as tight as the large size. I sent this back and got the XXL. Fits perfect. The other reason for a star off is for the value. It ended up costing me a total of $16 more to send both helmets back. The return process was simple and the folks at the other end of the line were very helpful and friendly. The shipping charges to return it for a new one makes me want to just try purchasing in a store instead of online for the money savings.\n",

I don't think there is a better modular helmet with all the features, comfort and ease of use that the HJC IS-Max 2 provides regardless of price. I had planned to spend around $400-$450 for a helmet but when I compared this helmet (I paid $188) I could find reason to spend twice as much. My only improvement I would like is better air flow. This helmet is good but I run hot, so I always want more. Cracking the visor open in \"city mode\" helps a lot with airflow but does increase the noise level so it is a compromise. I have had several other riders comment on the styling and impressed with the comfort and functionality when they tried it on. Most can't believe the price I paid for it. Very happy with this helmet.

I think Helmet fitting is going to have to go the way of custom fitting, like Ski boots. Unless you're real lucky, it's gonna be a crap shoot. Having had previous experience with HJC, I felt getting another 3XL would likely work. As new, it's a bit tighter on my upper cheeks than I'd like, after I bring down the upper part of helmet.

One of my cons is that the internal sun visor isn’t dark enough it gives everything a decent tint but on a bright sunny day riding toward the sun it’s not the best But it gets the job done.  It’s super comfortable, it’s not heavy but I did start to feel the weight after a long 2 hour ride, I’ll probably use my carbon fiber helmet for long rides from now on but this is definitely my top choice for my short commute to work.

This new helmet is better than the last in my opinion. Aerodynamics at speed in the interstate was very good. Seemed to be much less wind buffeting....(same wind screen on the bike as well.) what really impressed me was overall comfort, and the added padding in the neck roll which helped to reduce noise. I’d buy this helmet again and will certainly be brand loyal to HJC in the future\n",

Doesn’t matter.  Need to talk while getting gas? Bam you just lift the chin bar. It’s not super light and feels heavy with the bar up but seems fine to me when riding. Not sure the durability of the features yet as I’ve only had for about a month or so but nothing’s broken yet.\n",

      "Ive been using my IS MAX 2 helmet for 3 years now.  For the price it’s a fantastic buy.  The modular design and drop down sun visor is great.  It’s noisy on my bike, but that’s fixable with ear plugs, which I prefer anyways.  My biggest issue is that there’s two little plates under the modular portion that the chin portion pivots on. These have a little bump on them to hold the chin bar open. These parts are cheap plastic and break easily. I’ve broken two sets now. And when they break it may make it impossible to close the chin bar because of plastic interference in the joint. Revzilla has been great about sending replacement parts for free, but I wish I didn’t have to do this each year.\n",

January 2019 the chinbar vent started to show cracks and May2019 it completely fell off, I had to put some electrical tape to keep it in place. then the plastic holding the metal locking knob is broken. i have not dropped nor had an accident with this helmet.

After a few hours of break in riding, it is feeling pretty good.   I was amazed at the air flow with the chin and top vent open.  This was much better than the HJC 3/4 IS... I had been using.  I do ride with ear plugs, but it was quieter than the 3/4 as well.  If I come off the bike and land on my face, I feel like I will probably have a face left now.\n",

After an hour ride she complained that the helmet is top heavy and there’s that heavy pressure on top of her head like all the weight of that helmet is on that area and the cheek part is tight. On our way back home, we swapped helmets. We are both medium size. I was wearing a Schubert C3 helmet which i really like because its a lot more comfortable and much lighter than the hjc. And true enough there’s this area of the helmet that puts a lot of pressure on top of your head. HJC should probably redesign the cushioning on the top of the helmet. It is TOP HEAVY! You will feel neck sprain after less than an hour ride. I guess the spring loaded or activated sun visor mechanism was a design flaw. As i wrote this review, i am wearing the helmet itself and damn!, it’s heavy and that pressure on top of my head is terrible. Hope this helps anybody there decide if you still want this helmet. I regret buying this product.\n",

I've got a 58.5cm noggin, and got the large. The fit is spot on and I'm amazed at how comfortable it is. I hope the pads don't break in too much, because it is almost perfect right out of the box.It is pretty quiet, even though it flows lots of air. That air is coming primarily from the chin area, so you should probably go ahead and spring for the chin curtain when you get it, for cooler days. The shade is nice. It comes down far enough and seems dark enough, though I've only ridden on partly cloudy days so far. I'm thinking of adding a tinted pin lock so I can double the darkness when summer hits full force.\n",

I wear a medium which fit perfectly except in the cheek area. I ordered the XL cheek pads (they are the smallest) to give me more room but they were also too thick. I had to cut the back open and remove some padding so it would fit. It would push my cheeks in so much that I couldn’t shut my jaw. I’m 5’9 190 pounds with a smallish head.\n",

They are tight for the speakers, and could be a little tricky if you have big earls, but it worked for me. Maybe the only detail would be that indeed the internal sun visor is a little light and that the actuation system is kind of strange. Reaching it is not a very natural movement. Good helmet overall.

      "I just got back into riding after five year lapse and bought the new Air GT 2 and had to send it back immediately due to sizing It was backordered upon return, so I grabbed a cheaper modular helmet to keep as quick ride and passenger shel, and this thing blew me away for the price. It was a bit tight for the first few days, but broke in nicely and the mechanisms are tight and highly functional, esp the sun visor, which really works well both in deployment and the quick retraction fiction. The modular face needs a hard pill down to lock, but seats well and stays put. It is a giant sail when up, but other than the Shark designs, thats par for a modular. The venting is pretty light and the noise is higher than a full face, but not terrible for the 2-4 hour rides I normally take out to the Oregon coast and negligible for the 10 minute commute. The visibility is pretty great and the tint of the sunshield is just about right for most conditions. When comparing this to 600+ helmets, its a true bargain. I couldn't be happier with this shell for the price. I kind of fell in love with modulars because of this helmet, so I ordered the higher-end Shark flip back, which as gotten mixed reviews based on quality, so I'll post a review of that and compare when it comes tomorrow.\n",

I'm impressed with the fit of everything and believe it'll be a solid helmet for a few years.  Wind noise is surprisingly low and the front latch is very solid.

A bit tight at first (as most new helmets are) but it's fitting better with each ride.  No discomfort issues after 2+ hrs. Noise is a bit more than I'd like but I ride with ear plugs so not really an issue. As others have noted the drop down shaded visor is a bit too light. Bring your shades.  Chin lift mechanism is smooth and easy to use with winter gloves.  I am not a fan of the chin strap as I miss my Nolan's ratchet system.  (Why doesn't everyone use these?)  The visor stays in place when cracked partway open at fwy speed (with a windshield). Can't really speak too much for the air flow as I've kept it closed down as winter temps preclude the need for airflow. All in all I've been pretty happy with the purchase and will keep this for my knock around helmet when riding the Bonny.

So if you don’t mind looking like a human cake pop, this helmet is for you!2) I have some annoying issues with fogging in ~35 deg. F even with the vents open. Not a huge deal usually but it causes my glasses to fog too so trying to see the road through two layers of fogged glass is tough.3) the sun visor itself is AMAZING. I find that it’s about a centimeter too short so there’s a line of my vision that is not covered by the sun shade. The instant retraction button is fun though.4) this does not come with a chin curtain! My previous helmet did and it was not listed in the description so I had assumed this one did too. Because of the modular feature, there is a huge gap without the curtain but it catches on your chin a bit if you do have one. So really a personal preference.\n",

      "I just got this helmet as an inexpensive winter helmet (i.e. over-sized to fit a balaclava underneath) and well, it's not a great winter helmet.  My ratings above are based on the price point  and my expectations at that price.  It allows a lot of air-flow, even with all vents closed.  This helmet would be more at home behind a windshield (sport tourer etc.).  The lack of a chin skirt is perhaps the biggest issue (less behind a windshield as I said), and you have leaking around the sides where the chin bar meets the helmet proper when you turn your head, and on top where the drop-down visor lever is located (cold air hits a 3' patch of the top of your head).  All that said, I believe these issues are exaggerated by the cold air.  This helmet would be better suited to warm weather riding where you welcome the air, or are generally sitting behind a windshield.  It's a tad noisy (most of that is the open chin bar area) but not terrible.  It's a tad heavy, but not terrible.  I would not make this my primary helmet, but it's a good backup or seasonal option at this price.\n",

      "For those of you that have a very large head and must have a full face helmet like myself, this is a very good compromise with a flip face function which is great for those that are claustrophobic.  I come from an M2R 3XL (4XL not available in Australia where I live to try on) open face helmet that was extremely tight on my face and wouldn't really go all the way down over my head and was squashing the sides of my head to much.  I also had a Shoei XR-1100 3XL where the helmet did fit over the top of my head very good and felt extremely high quality, but even the lowest profile cheek pads simply put massive strain against my cheeks causing a lot of discomfort after several minutes.  The Shoei XR-1100 seems to have its chin guard 1mm or 2mm further away from the front of my mouth vs the HJC IS MAX 2 as I find I can touch the chin guard with my mouth much easier with the HJC IS MAX 2.  I also tried a HJC CL-17 full face helmet in 4XL and that hellmet could not get over my nose when I tried to put it on so I had to pass on it.  Perhaps the HJC CL-17 would fit over my head in 5XL but is not available in Australia for me to try so I can't confirm it.  If it wasn't for the HJC IS MAX 2 in 5XL, I wouldn't have purchased a new motorbike last week as I place a lot of focus on wearing protective gear.  I admit the quality of the HJC is not up there with the likes of the Shoei XR-1100 but the cost saving makes up for it, but is a better compromise than any open face helmet as far as I am concerned safety wise.  Well done HJC.\n",

      "One of the main reasons I got this helmet, regardless of price, is the S.H.A.R.P. helmet testing rating, which was 4 out of 5 stars. There are major brand full face helmets that didn't get 4 stars, but this modular did. And the chin bar stayed latched 100% during 30 impact tests (other modulars had the chin bar open during testing). Get a white one, it looks awesome, it stays cool in the sun, and most importantly, people will see you coming.\n",

      "I bought this helmet because I have bought HJC helmets before. I have used this helmet for a year now. The chin bar does not close correctly, the right side often latching with a crunch. I often tape the lower part of the face shield and use it as a visor pulling it part way down to shield from the sun. Weak face shield stops allow  crosswind or turbulence from a semi to flip the shield down.Wind noise on the left side of the helmet is unacceptable.\n",

      "This is a great helmet, although I had to go up one size to get it to fit comfortably.  I've found that HJC helmets fit my head best but they seem to be getting smaller with the newer models.  The only thing I would improve on this helmet is the air flow, I also have an HJC CL-17 and that one has great air flow.  Wish the IS Max 2 was like that one, but otherwise I really love the helmet.\n",

      "In early June 2018 I was with a group of guys riding the Dempster Hwy in the Yukon.  We had stopped in Whitehorse Yamaha for knobby tires.  I wasn't thrilled with the helmet I was wearing so I tried on the Max 2 and purchased it.  A few days later we were up on the most nasty newly opened Tuk highway.  Foot deep muddy ruts and snowing.  In some of the worst road I fell at about 10 mph and landed in the mud.  I don't remember hitting my head but I did because the leading edge of the chin vent cut the bottom of my nose where it meets my upper lip.  Blood everywhere and I had to get seven stitches When I really looked at the vent you can see it's got almost a razor sharp edge to it.  Now I'm in a situation where I either never wear it again or perform surgery and cut away the vent plastic somehow.  I can't imagine why they would place a weapon against you inside the helmet.  Based on on this I can't recommend the helmet and recommend anybody wearing it stop until you've resolved this issue for yourself. I'd give it a Zero rating if I could\n",

      "I used an off-brand (cheap) modular helmet for several years. I found it to be noisy with little or no air flow. When I purchased the HJC, these issues went away. For a modular, I found it had surprisingly good air flow, it was quiet, and it was lighter than my old helmet. I am extremely happy with this purchase. I have a fat face so I’m still waiting and hoping the cheek pads will “break in” but it’s something I notice, not necessarily an irritation. It’s nice to know I can buy smaller cheek pads if I need to.\n",

      "The price belies the features and quality in this helmet. I'm content enough to say it's my third Max strictly due to commuting and travelling and \"it's time to get one fresh.\"  They've revised the button for the internal sun visor - somewhat smaller than before yet does the job.  To my eye, the top and chin vents are larger and easier to toggle with gloves on.  It's noisier than some premium priced helmets, yet only by a fraction. The noise difference is barely noticeable when riding as I usually do, with ear plugs.  I have an HJC and Shoei head shape, sizing was as expected. My comfort rating is due to the subjectivity of fit and my inclination for a stylish helmet is indicative of: \"It fits, works as it should so I don't care about the style or appearance.\"Recommend?Absolutely. If it fits your head shape the IS Max is good value for the helmet dollar. Pinlock. Internal visor. Metal latch pins - all good.\n",

I wore the helmet last Saturday on a 155 mile ride and I love it. The fit was perfect and the wind and noise levels were reduced to almost nothing. I had read reviews of the MAX before I bought it and was worried about all of them giving the helmet a loud rating. Well, none of the reviewers must have ever ridden with a half helmet like me. I found the helmet to be very quiet. The internal sunshade is a great feature and the operation is smooth and simple. Oh, the reason I decided on the MAX was it being modular. I love that the chin bar moves up out of the way to allow for putting the helmet on and taking it off so easily. I received my order from Revzilla in two days and it was double boxed for extra protection. Overall I am glad I spent the money for this helmet.\n",

I rode 6000 miles with this lid back in 2016 and after that trip I had a red mark on the center of my forehead.  I will not be using this for LONG TRIPS again and only for short rides .I will be looking for most likely a NON modular long oval helmet unfortuantely before my next cross country ride.Otherwise this helmet works great.  But some glue near the visor has started coming down from the insides. I think it's an adhesive between where the visor is and the shell.Again if you are a long oval, expect forehead pressure.\n",

      "Everything you need in a helmet\n",
      "I've been wearing this helmet for a year now and I love it. I bought the gold mirrored shield and I highly recommend getting one if you buy this helmet (good looks and great protection from sun). The tinted drop-down is not dark enough to provide comfortable protection from the sun so adding the additional mirrored shield makes it perfect. I will say that the spring loaded mechanisms for dropping down the tinted visor is high quality and is very easy to use. With the touch a button, the visor retracts smoothly and instantly. All other helmets with a drop-down tinted visors feel cheap and fragile compared to this. I wish more helmets had this feature; it's just very well made. The modular element is a very nice feature. Sometimes (about 10% of the time) when I drop the chin guard down, it doesn't line up so it doesn't lock correctly. That doesn't bother me too much, because it's fixed easily.The HJC logo is big, bright white, and unattractive. BUT it can removed by carefully scraping off the label with a fingernail or thin edge. take care NOT to scratch the paint. I have the matt black color; no scratches came from this process but I can imagine it easily scratching if you're not careful. It looks much better without the logo now. I modified the front vent so that I could mount my GoPro 4 there. The chin guard can be easily and completely disassembled for this purpose. I was able to feed a microphone cable through the old vent port and into the helmet. It's a CLEAN setup. No loose wires. It honestly looks like it was made for this. By setting it up like this, I can still use the modular element without wires or the GoPro getting in the way. The only problem is that the weight of the GoPro will cause the chin guard to drop down on its own if you shake your head to hard. The groove for glasses is perfectly oriented for me. Very comfortable to wear glasses while riding. My glasses are large and they don't get in the way with anything. I installed the ScalaRider Paktalk communicator with the boom mic. Getting the setup to look clean and in the perfect location took some trial and error but now it looks flawlessly integrated. The speakers were too large to fit the recesses in the helmets foam so I had to compress/cut the foam in some areas to make it fit. These modifications were so small I do not fear that it is compromised or anything. Now it fits nicely; you don't even notice the speakers. With the GoPro and the Paktalk system, the helmet has become a bit heavier and noisier. I plan on reinforcing the seams with sealing strips to reduce wind noise. Lastly, get the pinlock system. If you are a heavy breather or if you talk in your helmet, the shield will fog. The pinlock system fixes this perfectly. High recommend getting the insert for both clear and mirrored shields.\n",

      "It looks great on the internet and it also looks great in person however I believe now that I've shopped around even more it is severely overpriced you can find same quality for a whole lot less and as far as the flaws the area of the chin the air comes in between the chin and the front part of the plexiglass area. At high speeds the helmet feels like it's about to fly off it is a medium speed helmet at best. I am unhappy with the price I paid and the level of quality in the helmet.although it looks beautiful it feels as if it's going to break like a piece of china glass the moment I hit it against anything at all.

      "Ordered Tuesday morning - Received Thursday mid-afternoon.  Awesome service.  And it was not a simple order and ship.  I had ordered the wrong helmet, when called and changed the order Revzilla's customer service rep was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  Now for an early review.  I have used similar HJC modular helmets for years (this is my third one) and have always felt positive about them. Previously a SY-MaxII saved my head, face, and possibly my life when my bike was rear-ended and totaled while at the rally in Sturgis, SD. Sliding down the road on my face while watching the blacktop shred the eye shield made me a believer. I replaced that helmet with another SY-MaxII that I have worn for years.  It was showing its wear and when I dropped it, I knew it was time for a replacement.This helmet fits tight (no honey, I am not puckering up for the women across the way). But not too tight and I know from experience it will adjust with wear.  Really like the no-tool handle-locker for changing the shield.The one-hand chin guard lever is easy to operate and the helmet feels secure when closed and fastened against the metal stops.  Seems to be more secure than the system used previously. But, the guard and helmet did their jobs with the old system.I installed a new Sena 10C as soon as I received the helmet.  Other than making one slight adjustment to accommodate the wires the installation went well.  I am anxious to try them both out.As I said, this is an early review.  Items not checked will be evaluated when I return from a scheduled 10,000-mile solo ride covering twenty-two states later this year.  The 10C will enable me to record pictures I have missed on previous excursions.  When the ride is completed, I will do comprehensive reviews of both the camera and the helmet.\n",

A salesman took this helmet off of a display rack and let me try it on and it was exactly what I was looking for. Light weight, modular design. It did lack the sun visor which I wish I had from time to time but it does have the sun glasses that come down from the inside. I bought this for a 1,500 mile trip I was taking. Long story short, I rode across Texas in 70 degrees and sunny, the airflow is amazing and felt like I had air conditioning all around my head and face. This helmet fit me better and I have had no issues with fogging up the face shield like on my last helmet.This is my first modular helmet so I cant really compare it to anything I've used long term, the ones I tried on from competitors did not even come close to matching the HJC comfort level. I did not order from Revzilla because I was crunched for time but I did pay more money which I do not regret. This helmet is worth every penny in my opinion.\n",

I never felt uncomfortable with all the lining in the helm, even with earplugs in. Good on ya' HJC- Chin bar. It is a bit far away from the face, giving the feel you're in a much larger, safer vessel. It also had rock solid lock up when closed.CONS:The sun visor ratchet. It was quite awkward to actuate at highway speeds, having to reach your hand on top of the helm fighting 70 MPH winds. It can be done, but you might miss on your first shot. - Noise level. I wear -22 db. earplugs, and it was still a bit loud (in comparison to my current helmet a Scorpion GT920 modular) on the interstate. - Hi-Viz Version. It's more expensive than the matte black one I had. Booooo.CONCLUSION:If it could've survived getting run over when my bud was moving his car, I wouldn't have ordered a replacement.

My first helmet, also an HJC (CL-14 full face), was also undersized.  Fit and finish is top notch. Also all kinds of little pleasures, like the drop-down sun visor are also appreciated. Like other modulars, it's a little noisy in stiff wind, but that a price one pays for the convenience of lifing the front portin of the helmoet awaqy from the face when stopped for gas, etc.I'd say, buy with confidence.

I find the sun visor more and more useful as I choose to leave my sun glasses in the tank bag.A common complaint of wind noise really isn't something I can agree with simply because I have never used a premium full face helmet before.  In fact, I find this helmet much quieter then the half helmets I used to wear.I recently added a Cardo Packtalk to the IS Max II and had no problems attaching it to the helmet.

      "I was debating between this and an AGV EVO Modular. I decided to give the HJC a try and I'm glad I did. The wind and noise level is definitely dampened, but as with most modular helmets there is a tad bit of noise at 65mph and faster. I have yet to encounter any whistling or overbearing wind noises and that is a huge plus since I am a commuting rider. The HJC's construction really does a well job at dampening the noise, while not completely eliminating it. The visor drops exactly where it needs to be and has the perfect shade amount to my liking. Not too dark but not too light. I have noticed that it does not come with a curtain and the shield does tend to start fogging at stops if the face isn't lifted after a minute or two. All in all, I am completely satisfied with this helmet.Pros:FitNoise ReductionVisor drop levelDecent ventilation Cons:Lack of curtainFogging of shield\n",

      "OK, so this is my first motorcycle and first motorcycle helmet, at age 58. Although I have no experience with helmets, this seems like a good one and makes me wonder what else could you need in a helmet. The one thing I would mention right away is my head measures a medium but I ordered a large and it fits perfectly, no movement at all when I move left and right but not tight spots. It's not a problem but everyone needs to know. I liked the color selections; I got the anthracite and it looks good. The modular feature is the best, so useful.\n",

      "I wanted to get a few miles on it before I wrote a review. I got a large, I was at the top edge of large, should got an XL. Snug, but doable. The more it wears in the better it gets, been 2 months now. Sound is great, nice and quiet. I added the Sena 20s. No one can tell Im riding at 70mph. GREAT! When I first got it I could feel the top vents moving air, not so much anymore. Not sure if its cause my punkin takes up to much room and forces the pads up or cause it just warm out. It does stay pretty cool so I guess they work. I got the light smoke silver shield, Dont really need the drop down, unless im heading into the sun, but it does work perfect with the shield I bought, no more need for glasses and I can see at night clearly with the light smoke. My ONLY complaint......GET THE PINLOC SHIELD! when its muggy out and the temp is a bit low the shield does fog up and clears up a bit to slow for my taste. Im ordering the pinloc shield, I hope it clears up the problem. I hate to have to crack my shield up cause then it gets hard to hear anything on the SENA 20s. Great lid, good price, tight fit. And I ride a Harley and I can hear perfectly with the shield closed.\n",

The fit is excellent! Two things could be improved: 1. Ventilation, and 2. A slightly darker tint to the sunshade. Having said that, neither is a deal breaker, though. Also I don't care for the auto-retract sun screen mechanism that many helmets have (this one included). I prefer a manual mechanism that lets me determine how far down I set it.

      "Let's be honest Revzilla is just doing there job too sell the helmets for manufacturers and they sell them well but we the consumers are who give the truest reviews.This helmet looks good just a bit heavy and deafening at 60+mph and you will want too invest in noise canceling custome ear plugs to enjoy a long ride not even sure you could use a communication device and hear it, hot kidding. I had the shield up and colored inner visor down and that was expected to be loud with wind tunnel effects but then the rain came so I switched the view too my outer clear and close outer shield and it was the exact same sound level very noisy and it instantly started too fog up (I don't have an inner pinlock lens so I'd expect fog on moist day) , not even kidding. ***Note Im in Waxahachie so around Dallas, TX area where it's 95*+with heat index of 105+ and rain every few days (steaming hot and humid). My wife said yesterday you removed your helmet and you look like you just got out of shower do you have your vents open? Yes, I did but zero help the helmet is just, hot! The two vents and 4 extractors aren't cutting my Texas climate I'd say this helmet is better rated for 45*-85* for a comfort zone. I did talk too service manager at local bike store and he said he's been told the buyer demographics of rides who buy this helmet from his store are aged ranged between 16-30 years of age they love the half face lift button but over 30 prefer a true full helmet or just a half due to extreme heat and noise when cruising. If you want to enjoy the ride and not need hearing aids after your done this helmet isn't for you. Now I have 60% hearing loss in left ear between ranges 45-80 decibels but perfect hearing on right side. Other then the the wine colored HJC IS Max 2 helmet looks great I hope this helps you decide on whether to buy this product or not.\n",

I was talking on the phone at 80 mph but had a hard time hearing. At 70 it is much quieter. I'm sure the only factor is the wind deflection on your bike.Riding in some rain I mostly had the shield down and that works well but there is a lack of ventilation. Probably due to the chin curtain I installed and the wind deflection of the bike again.I really like the convenience of the modular design and the tinted slide down visor is awesome.

Kinda bummed, but it still is an ok helmet. The pinlock system worked great!! The styling is what I like best about the helmet. Overall, just an average helmet.

It arrived quickly, as always, and after wearing it for an hour, while sitting on the sofa, I had no issues with the liner. I took the chin curtain, I bought and put into the Capstone, and put it into the large. After riding for about 2 hours, I felt fine and only had a minor indent from the liner. The internal visor is perfect. It provides the right amount of shading so I don't have to wear additional glasses. If the helmet came with the chin curtain, it would have been a 5.\n",

      "It is very hard to find a helmet that is both big enough and fits the shape of my head. I have a round/oval shaped head and it is difficult ordering helmets online because you don't know accurate the description is. RevZilla usually says \"intermediate oval\" or \"round\" and this helmet is just in between them. I wear a 3xl and it is extremely comfortable. I mostly ride a Yamaha Venture with a fairing and windshield and it works pretty well. I can ride on the freeway without earplugs and it isn't very loud at all, although I did buy the chin skirt for a little bit more and think it is great but wish it was just included. The drop down visor is nice, comes all the way down to the bridge of my nose. The only gripe I have is that it fogs up with the visor closed in the cold. Today was 40* and I had to keep it cracked open or I couldn't see. Keep in mind, this is on a full fairing bike and only get airflow on the top of my helmet. I may try the breath box add on but it doesn't get very good reviews. Airflow is great when riding my naked bike.To sum up: I really like this helmet! It fits my oddly shaped/sized pumpkin and it has tons of features that make it a very good value.  I don't think it is too heavy either, I rode for 2 hours today and feel like I could go out and ride a lot more.\n",

      "Heard about wearing a helmet more than 5 years old. Went to check mine and it was a 2007 and now is 2017. Have been wearing a Shoei Multitec for the whole time. So can only compare to it. I got 10 years out of the Shoei so I guess new helmet time. The Zilla guys suggested this one and at the price I went for the white.It's a lot quieter, has more vision, lighter and has a nearly useless sun visor. Not built as good as the Shoei but costs 3 times less than the Neotec.I put some electrical tape on the top of the sun visor so now it acts as a sun visor when needed. Works great. I used to have some X-ray film stuck on the inside of my helmet to do that.NEGATIVES:1-a lot less room in the mouth area but still room for a mic for the Sena2-no way to slightly crack the visor like the Shoei3-feels \"cheaper\" but is lighter. I tightened up the modular chin piece screws and used blue lock-tite and that helped the \"feel\" Visor seems flimsy but seals better4-it's a fog monster-GET A PINLOCk insert5-no chin piece-get one. It's got a really good installation system better than the Shoei.The liner is removable so you can wash it out a great feature. Good ventilation when moving and seems to be built for the upright position of dual sport, classics and adventure, sport touring bikes. Happy with the purchase\n",

I have been riding in cold temps and have noticed that my face shield fogs at slower speeds with vents wide open.  Opening the face shield one notch clears the fog immediately.  Couple that with glare through the visor when driving into the sun and I have felt very uncomfortable with the impaired vision for brief periods of time.  I hope HJC will consider offering a polarizing sun visor in the future if it is not already available.  All in all, I like the helmet, recommend it to others, and would purchase it again.

Liner and shield are easy to remove and clean. Lot's of cool air flow. Chin deflector, separate purchase, blocks a lot of the air as the temp. drops. Very noisy helmet, my ears ring after an hour ride as it seems to amplify the volume of my Vance and Hines pipes, so I wear earplugs quite often.

So far no regrets, the XL fits very similarly to the symax2 XL. I cannot really tell that much of a difference in fit or features.The drop down sun screen mostly works -- I commute in very sunny central Texas daily and it could be darker in my opinion. It is still much nicer than helmets without it though.I had some issues with my old symax visor fogging up on some mornings ride, so I sprung for a pinlock insert this time around. I unfortunately have not had a chance to see how it performs in adverse weather yet though.The pads are easily removable/washable if necessary.

      "I have a love/hate relationship with this helmet. I purchased it early in the season, and have ridden about 2000 miles over 3 months with it. I commute almost daily on my bike, and have taken some decent distance long-weekend trips with it.Pros:- Good price- 2-position internal sun visor is awesome- Once the medieval-torture-device cheek pads broke in, it was very comfortable, fit my head perfectly- super easy to get the liner & pads out for washing- Decent but not great air-flow- Not too loud, not too heavyCons:- One of the two screws that holds visor & chinbar to the main body of the helmet just fell out randomly one morning rendering the helmet 100% non-useful... which I discovered while moving at 45 MPH.I'd stopped at a diner for breakfast on the way home from a long weekend trip and when I was making ready to leave, I noticed a large, odd-looking screw on the ground next to my bike, that didn't LOOK like anything that belonged to me. I grabbed it and put it in my pocket, just sort of out of habit. I got my helmet on, somehow not noticing it was missing a screw (which is odd, when you think about it, I wasn't even hungover) and got on the road; when I went to adjust my visor a few miles down the road, the chin-bar/visor assembly basically came half-separated from the helmet. I managed to duck into a gas station and once I recovered from the heart palpitations, I was able to re-secure my helmet with the missing screw that (thank god) I'd unknowingly snagged off the ground in the diner parking lot.So... you be the judge. Is only paying $209 for a decently-equipped modular helmet worth having to check the screws that hold it together every morning before you leave for work? I don't think so. I'll be getting a new helmet in the not-too-distant future, for sure.\n",

It's out of the way from the wind and I like where it is.The helmet isn't super quiet. In fact, the first time I wore it there was some whistling. That went away quickly though.The button on the chin strap isn't very easy to manage with gloves on. It seems kind of small and it rests on top of the D rings, which makes it a little unbalanced.

The shield snaps down into closed with a positive click and seals very well. the internal sunvisor has 3 positions I find with my facial features that i use the very first lock otherwise it can come in contact with my nose (hey HJC can you make a gradient visor?).ventilation seems good for this price point as does weight. the shell is a nice gloss black but the gloss seems shallow, in previous modulars I've experienced a loosening of chin bar fasteners but I haven't run into that with this helmet yet. overall i like the helmet and i can recommend the helmet (i'll be upgrading my wife to the same model in fact)\n",

      "Yes, you heard it right. This helmet can't even help itself so I don't think it can help you!!! Its parts come off by itself. Do your head and your wallet a favor and don't buy it. You will spend $200 for something that will hopefully just be trash very soon, if not becomes the reason of your death!I got my helmet about 2-3 months ago and because I am very busy running an engineering firm in DC, I can't ride much. Also I am a motorcyclist with 20 years of experience and I know how to handle equipment. I wore this helmet for about 1000-1200 miles. It is cheaply built, very plasticky but at first felt ok. Until its pivot point screw fell by itself and I was stuck far away from home with a faulty helmet. It can happen to you too. You can believe how fun it can be!!! Check the photos:\n",

      "Overall a good helmet\n",
      "So overall I enjoy this helmet. It is not very noisy, it fit very well and the sun visor and pinlock option were excellent. The only issue I have is the quality. I have had to remove the inside padding about 6 times to install a Bluetooth setup. On one of the 2 helmets I purchased the glue has started to fail on the plastic piece in which the padding clips in to. While it has not been a catastrophic failure yet it is only a matter of time before it comes completely off and I will have to reglue it. Given that the padding was designed to be removed and I have not done so excessively I would have expected maybe a better glue or it is possible that the one side was not done properly. Outside of all this I like the helmet as the padding issue does not affect the function. I only wish they would have made the sun visor with a pinlock option. While it is great having no fog on the main shield, it does no good when using the sun visor and it is all fogged up.\n",

The modular system on it is comfertable and ergonomic as well it is reliable I have never had it fall well I'm riding or pop loose, very reliable.As a testament to the revzilla service team, my helmet had a factory defect when I got it. Revzilla couldn't have stopped it there was one screw bouncing in the helmet. I sent it in and in two days I had a new helmet that perfect at no additional cost or hassle to me. If your thinking of getting a modular helmet with it spending upwards of 300 dollars, stop looking this one is it.\n",

Two downfalls: Left side of the helmet strap is kinda chunky, creating a bit of a pressure point on my jaw/chin, and the sun visor does not seem to be anti-fog. Try as I might to get the clear shield to fog, it will not, but the sun visor certainly does.Pros: Good (subjective) styling, good build quality, good fit overall, metal retention hardware for the modular functionality..Are there nicer helmets out there? Sure. I'm a big believer in diminishing returns though, and this helmet offers great features at the price I paid.\n",

      "Just kidding Revzilla, don't have a heart attack. Truth is, I think this helmet is great. For one that's around 200 bucks it's a steal too. This is my first modular so I can't compare it to any other modular but it's my second HJC. I think for the price it's really quiet compared to other 200 dollar helmets I've had. I think for most riders, owning helmets is a progression thing; we buy 200 dollar helmets but in the end we get a Shoei or an Arai or even a Schuberth and look for specific things like reduced wind noise which is why my next helmet will be the Shoei Quest. Now that I've had a modular I know it's not a feature that is high on my list as for as lids go since I don't smoke, well maybe sometimes. Just kidding Revzilla!\n",

The internal sunvisor lets me keep my eyes protected while getting some wind during the day, and fits well even when I'm wearing my glasses.Bluetooth compatibility: I ride with a Sena SMH10.

Being modular, it is extremely convenient when I need to speak to someone at stops, and can't be bothered removing the helmet from my head. The internal sun visor has proven to be an excellent feature, as I don't need to bring my sunglasses with me anymore when I ride, and I don't need to keep taking them on and off when stopping. A simple slide to activate, and press to hide. Amazing.Regarding the airflow going in, I've found it to be a little lacking compared to my other HJC, but I think this is offset by the fact that the vents at the back work really well so even if there isn't that much air coming in, it's not hot inside because the hot air is vented really well.One complaint I have is that it does not come with a pinlock insert, but I can just transfer the one that came with my previous helmet to this one.Great product, would definitely recommend.

I've been riding offroad for years with a standard full face helmet so no need to go \"official\" with a $700 helmet with barely any features.Back to this HJC IS-Max2: it's great having the chin bar up when taking a drink, digging in your pockets, using the facilities, talking to a fellow rider at a stop light, and coughing or sneezing without spraying inside. I'm sold on modular for now on and it's what I'll always wear.As for other thoughts, it gets great air flow WITH the chin bar down. If I'm getting hot all I need to do is stand on my pegs and whoosh the air comes in. Winter is about to hit and I ride everyday all year. I'm a little concerned about it being too cold (especially when I'm on my pegs a lot offroad) but I've got a good balaclava. Vents seem to pull moisture well. I've got an oval head and this is a little too round for me but not a deal breaker. I love the TWO POSITIONING of the internal shield. It's only about a quarter inch further down but that's what you'll need when you've got sun glare coming off your instrument gauges.

The first click open is at a perfect width for extra airflow without getting debris in my eyes or snapping shut. The Pin-Lock pins took some getting used to as they are within my peripheral vision.My biggest complaint is that the control for the sun visor snapped off after catching in the lip of my pannier, so it's essentially unusable. The construction was incredibly flimsy, with maybe 1mm of plastic holding the control in place. One side simple broke away. The SyMax was a one-piece design that was very durable. I can't understand why they would go to this new one as it seems it would be more expensive to produce, but it is very inferior.\n",

Airflow is adequate but could be better. My only major complaint is echoed by many other reviewers: the drop-down sun shield is not dark enough.

      "Stepped up from the previous version of IS Max after 5 years. Love that this version is much lighter, better ventilation. Appropriately tight out of the box. Sat around with it on for about an hour before going for my first ride--very comfortable, no hot spots, really fits great. Nice addition of channels for glasses, makes all the difference. Still need to take my glasses off before I put it on or take it off but they slide in and come out easily. I expect that before too long I'll be able to keep my glasses on like I was able to with my previous IS Max. Helmet is fairly quiet, but with different air noise than the previous version. Added pin lock and chin curtain. Pin lock went in easily and there is no distortion with sun shield up or down. Looking forward to seeing how it works to keep fog down when the mornings start to get colder. The chin curtain snaps in and out easily with the installed snaps in the chin bar. For about $5 it should be a big help in colder weather. Overall very happy with the helmet.\n",

      "I wanted a module helmet that fell in this price range. This helmet has covered all the basis that I want and I have really enjoyed it. The module feature is super easy to use and makes a huge difference when stopped at a stoplight in the summer. I've even rode with the face up and the shaded glass feature down. The padding fits great and is snug almost all the way to my chin. It was pretty tight at first and after a couple weeks of riding it's loosened up and fits perfect. Very true to size. It's a little louder than an older helmet I had but nothing bad at all. I wear one headphone in to listen to music when I ride and I can hear it just fine. Overall a great helmet for the price range that you're looking. I'd recommend this helmet to anyone that asked.\n",

      "I like everything about this helmet and I believe it is a great buy for the money. Only problem I had is when I installed J&M equipment into the helmet (from my old HJC helmet, which was very comfortable on my head.) Both speakers, especially the right one, exerted too much pressure on my ears/temple, especially via my glasses. Also had a difficult time putting the glasses on because of the tightness. Seemed to resolve the problem by stripping the speakers down to the bare speaker and installing under the helmet liner in the recesses provided (wouldn't really fit in the recess with speaker padding in place.) It was a long 300-mile ride with the initial speaker installation because of discomfort at the sides of my head (which I didn't really notice when just \"trying on\" the whole setup.) Feels fine now but waiting for the next ride to really put it to the test.Otherwise, a very nice helmet, ... (;-)\n",

ALWAYS.The fit is small and does not follow their size chart. Based on the size chart I was a medium. After sending the helmet back for a few exchanges I ended up with a 4X helmet. Even if the first measurement was human error the next 2 were not.Would be nice to have this helmet with Bluetooth already built in.\n",

I ride fairly long distances (couple hours) each day for work and the helmet is light enough not to become a strain on my neck or feel too heavy. It's not too light though where it feels cheap. Good construction, quieter than my last H@rley modular helmet in the similar price range.Cons: Smoked sun visor needs to be tinted darker. When I'm riding east in the morning the sun visor barely takes the edge off. Before I got my tinted no-fog inserts I had to wear sunglasses in addition to my sun visor. I've thought about taking the sun visor out and tinting it darker but haven't needed to now that I just leave the tinted no-fog insert in 24/7. Makes night time riding a little dark but not bad.\n",

      "So I've been riding in this thing for just over three months now and I'm happy with my purchase. I have a huge jug head and I tried to go by hat size and it didn't work. I wear a 7 7/8 - 8 in a fitted cap and am comfortable in a 5x helmet. HJC is just about the only game in town if you need a lid that big. There are others but don't waste your time.For the price this thing is loaded with features. I went with matte black and the finish is holding up excellent so far. I like the drop down sun visor and really appreciate the modular flip up face panel. Too handy to even go into detail about. Needless to say I won't be going back.The visor does fog but I find I like riding with it cracked unless it's raining hard. Perhaps I'll invest in a Pinlock when it gets cold again.It ventilates adequately. Probably just average though. I wear a helmet liner with mine just to keep perspiration off of the pads. You can get away with less dissection of the guts by using one so I do.It seems fairly quiet. I have a fairly loud 48 with Rush 2.0s and it knocks it down several decibels. I can still here her purring, just mutes it slightly. No wind noise unless the shield is cracked.Overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. My one caveat is with the drop down sun visor. Sometimes it catches before it goes completely back into the helmet. Just an eighth of an inch but I have to use my hand to pull back on the mechanism to get it fully disengaged. Not the end of the world, just a little quirk I've grown to live with when it happens. Thanks HJC for making a proper helmet for a jughead!Oh and it works perfectly if you wear prescription eyeglasses. Plenty of room.\n",

      "Going point by point:Fit is about perfect. My noggin doesn't like putting helmets on, but flipping the chin guard up makes it a pinch to put the helmet on. It fit a tiny bit smaller than expected, but once it's on it is extremely comfortable (wore it for about two hours after I got it while playing Destiny, no headache afterwards).Noise level is pretty good. Gets a little loud at highway speeds, but that's to be expected. Surface street speeds I get good sound feedback such as engine revs, horns, and so on, but it's not overly loud or damaging.Nice and lightweight. Neck doesn't feel sore holding it up after long rides.Shape is a little narrower, which is likely where my original fit issues came into play. Those with round heads beware.I've got good peripherals here, and checking before lane changes is easy with a flick of my head.The inner visor is easy to use once you get used to the positioning of the switch, and the release is nice too. That being said, I generally wear some Nike Tailwinds instead for a different tint color and polarization. Still a good inner visor, but I prefer my own sunglasses.Chin guard flip is extremely useful, and the visor itself opens cleanly.Rides:1998 Honda VFR Interceptor 8002001 Honda Shadow Spirit 750\n",

I purchased the size that seemed to feel correct in the store and my measurements confirmed the fit. However when the IS-Max 2 arrived, it was uncomfortably snug. The review is correct, the _shape_ *has* changed slightly and the folks who said the sizing seems to run smaller are also correct. I'm sending mine back to step up one size. There's no way I could wear my so called \"correct\" size for an extended period.I will give an updated review when I actually get to use it, rather than merely try it on.\n",

The Nolan N104 XXXL was the best fit.After about 6 months and a few thousand miles I found I could never get rid of the Nolan hot spots. Also the Nolan was not an easy fit for my SENA 20S system.PROThe HJC IS Max 2 fit better, flows more air, works better with the physical mounting of the Sena 20S than the Nolan (For my head). The Nolan also rattles through the top vent.

      "Multiple features offered in a comfortable helmet\n",
      "This was my first HJC brand and my first modular I've owned. My noggin measures 59cm/22 1/4in. As with all my previous helmets I've owned, I went with a Large and the fit was spot on for my oval noggin. I've owned primarily Arai in the past, and they do make a good helmet - they unfortunately don't make a modular version. So I went with HJC for the modular preference. I also chose the Anthracite color which looks way better in real life than online. After reading about potential fogging issues, I added the pinlock anti-fog shield and a chin-curtain to this purchase. I haven't ridden in the rain yet with this lid, so I can't speak to it's effectiveness on anti-fogging. But I find a foggy visor to be both extremely annoying as well as really unsafe. So taking measures to curb this makes sense to me. I love the sun shield on this helmet. It is slightly too light, but never-the-less a really welcome feature in a helmet (at this price range.) The modular aspects of this lid work excellent. Easy to use, nice here in Texas at red lights to help get a little cooler air around my face. The venting could be better, although I ride with my visor up - sun shield down while riding most of the time anyway. So for me, this isn't as much of an issue as some reviews have stated. The chin strap is ok. I wish it had one of those cloth tabs on the one D-ring to help manipulate with feeding the strap through the two D rings when putting the helmet on. I've been thinking of adding one homemade tab to mine. The liner feels decent, but could be a little softer. But not a deal breaker at all. Overall I really like this helmet! Very pleasantly surprised with the overall quality in this lid, considering the price! HJC - make the liner softer and the tint on the visor a shade darker - increase ventilation and even with a price increase of $100 making this a $300 helmet would be a very welcome thing in my opinion. Thanks for the assistance and great customer service Revzilla! Much appreciated!\n",

The helmet is tight on my jawline, even after getting it 1 size bigger than my measurements.The airflow through the little hole in the front, and the little hole on the top was very weak. It was getting hot inside.The visor knob on the top of the helmet broke off on my second ride, when I pushed the knob fully forward. The visor snapped back up into the helmet. I don't know what to do to fix it...Wind buffeting is noticeable and the wind noise is there, but not too loud. The button to open up the shell works very well. The strap is cheap. The windshield tightens down when in the fully closed position, and holds all positions firmly.The helmet feels very light, and the vision is superb.\n",

      "Good value, with a few caveats\n",
      "I chose this helmet because I love the convenience of a modular helmet, but still wanted something fairly sporty and aggressive looking to go with my CBR. I was debating between this and the Bell Revolver, and in the end I'm glad I decided to go HJC.It's quiet compared to my previous modular, but still loud as far as full face helmets go. That's par for the course; you can't block every little bit of air coming in through the modular seams. At first I was worried about comfort: I've been ordering medium helmets in various brands for years and have never had an issue with fit, but when I first put this helmet on, it felt tight, especially around my cheeks. I'm happy to report that it has loosened up after a few hours of riding, and now it's comfortable as can be. The feature set for this price point is good, with one caveat (which I'll go over later). Internal sunvisor, room enough for a small bluetooth system, 2 vents.Now, a few nitpicks.This helmet does not come with a chin curtain. I believe for a $200 helmet, something so basic should be a given. I ordered one for an additional $12.The internal sunvisor is great to have, but I am disappointed with how light it is. It helps minimally on sunny days, to the point that you'd probably be better off with a $5 pair of sunglasses -- or if you do most of your riding during the day, just invest in a dark visor.Last nitpick; the top of the visor does not seal well. There is a rubber border, but it doesn't touch the entire visor and allows air (and noise) to seep in.Overall, though, I am pleased with the helmet and have confidence it will protect me in the event of an accident. Besides the issues I listed, the fit & finish is excellent. This was my first HJC and likely won't be my last.\n",

Head shape i guess. This helmet has very good fit and finish. Vision is great, not as heavy, and quieter. Overall a better helmet than SyMax, and cheaper.

We ride 2 up and she likes the protection of this helmet.Pros: Inexpensive helmet. great fit. Comes ready for pin lock.Cons: Wired head set fits OK, Does have wind noise but not so loud that you want another helmet.\n",

With this I just retract the tinted inner visor! I can hear my blu tooth unit perfectly with this lid!! Now that I have tried one I will be upgrading to a better shell! To me the helmet is the most important piece of equipment you can possibly purchase!! Overall this helmet is fantastic!!\n",

      "I have felt for some time I need a full face helmet to keep my contact lenses from drying and popping out...a very bad circumstance... so I have an older Helmet...HJC SyMax (no number, Just SyMax). I have always appreciated its fit and function. Its old now and I really need a bit more cooling for Texas riding... and the IS Max II (2?) is exactly what I needed. Superb venting...even with the vents closed. This will make the spring and autumn rides WAY comfortable. Noise control is impressive...so much so I forgot my ear plugs and didn't remember until 75% done with my ride. I only remembered as I thoughtfully regarded the helmet I was wearing and realized I was spongy-doodleless. The next day I realized I was being buffeted by 10-15 mph crosswinds and wasn't really hearing the harshest buffeting inside the helmet. I thought I must be mistaken and maybe it had something to do with the wind direction...but a crosswind is just that. WONDERFUL HELMET!This is a 9 month Texas helmet. I purchased an IS-33 for the summer(other 3 months). Contact lenses or not...the venting, fit, construction, functions, and field of view are great in the SyMax II and the IS-33!\n",

      "My wife and I are fifth year riders. We started out with 3/4 HJC helmets, then went with Harley half helmets. I decided that we needed a lot more protection. Looked at full faced and didn't even consider modular at first, The wife got a little claustrophobic with the full face, tried the modular and she said she could do this. Since we'd had HJC helmets before we tried the IS MAX 11. Our measurements indicated a small for her and a medium for me, but we ended up with a medium for her and a large for me, they run a little small. Have only rode about 4 hours with them so far. Very quiet, little or no wind buffeting, and good ventilation. The left cheek pad bothered me after a while. I called revzilla about different size cheek pads, they recommended compressing the pad to speed up breakin, haven't had a chance to try it again (still snowing). Really like the helmets and revzilla is great to deal with.\n",

      "I just got 2 of these today for the wife and I so this is an initial impression. The helmets are great looking and solid for a modular. Very comfortable. The only knock is the internal shield mechanism on the top is kind of flimsy. The unlock button on one of the helmets kept flying off when ever I lowered the shield. I drop of super glue fixed it but if anything fails over time it will be this mechanism. We took a light ride to lunch and back. City traffic, 50-55 mph. This helmet is amazingly quiet for a modular and this is without a chin curtain. I assume it would be even quieter with one on. I am impressed after trying other modulars in the same price range. You know the ones with the \"BILT\" in bluetooth....don't do it, they are utter garbage. I did also get the SENA SMH10 intercom set up and it was not difficult to install on these helmets. I chose SENA over HJC's intercoms because of very poor reviews. I'll post a review on the SMH10 after I try them out. Again I bought these helmets for touring and chatting with the wife, so far I would highly recommend them for the price point. I'd drop $2500 for a C3 Pro set up and this was about 1/4 that price.\n",

I'm still not sure about the fighter pilot drop down sunglasses thingy but everyone i show it to thinks its cool.( mind you they don't ride so i don't care about their opinion , -that's kind of a joke)\n",

The helmet is truly bad ass in person and looks great, however, the fit just isn't right. I'm a large in scorpion helmets and my other 2 fit perfect, but this one doesn't match my head. around the head fits alright, but the sides are not long enough. My ears sit too low in the helmet and thus are pressed on by the chin strap when it's tightened. My other problem with the helmet is that the visor doesn't lock when it's up or down, it just kinda rests in position. Summing it up, If you have more of a round head, then this helmet is for you.\n",

It's comfortable, light, and looks cool.  The holes at the mouth allow for a nice breeze to cool your face and keeps it from fogging.Complaints:*  I wish there was an opening in the back for air to vent through.  The vents in the muzzle and forehead are nice, but they don't really keep the rest of your head cool.*  The smoked visor broke when I was snapping it in.*  I find that the muzzle limits the bottom of my field of vision somewhat.The pros definitely outweigh the cons for me with this helmet.

Overall satisfied but it could use a little more width in my opinion because I do have a slightly wider head. I also like the fact that it comes with two visors, one smoke that’s already on the helmet then the clear one that comes in the box.

I compared this helmet to the HD Pilot helmet and found very few differences, the reason I went with this helmet was the Rev helmet came with both the clear and tinted shield.  HD charges $30 extra for the second shield. This helmet has great airflow and offered great protection against driving rain, the helmet offers little to no structural protection for your face in the event of an accident however.As far as comfort goes, I took the bottom padding out that wraps around your chin and ears because there are no cut outs for your ears and crushes them. Once that was gone the helmet feels great.All in all, great helmet for the money.\n",

After a year of use, here are the pros and cons of this helmetPro:- relatively inexpensive- very stylish- optional configuration- comes with both clear and tinted visor, and they're very easy to swap out- good airflow- light- very stylish (it's worth two points)cons:- slightly limited vision- no rear vent, helmet tends to pull at high speed- they could've done without the half helmet option. It looks pretty stupid- no option for BT speakers- due to the high airflow, it gets loud on the highway- mask magnet insert is secured with 3 short screws each side, two of which already got popped off just from me holding itImprovement suggestions:- do away with the half helmet option and just make it 3/4 with a mask- BT speaker pockets- rear vent- magnet clip permanently glued to the maskI think with these improvements you can make this into a true every day helmet.

During the summer time this helmet will be the best thing since sliced bread regarding look,  and airflow. I haven't smashed it yet god willing so I cant speak for safety.

      "Riding on cold mornings is not the strong suit of this helmet. However when it warms up I feel I get great airflow. All that said, it’s because the modularity of this helmet allows a lot of air to pass through its connectors.  The interchangeable visor is quick and easy and they include the clear and smoke so you are covered for any riding condition. I also connected my Sean 20s with no issues. Some had said it’s too tight a fit to pull off, but with a little ingenuity it was installed in about half an hour. Looks great, feels great!!\n",

      "This helmet has been one of the best buys I’ve had in a long time. At has made a great alternative to a half shell and looks every part as cool if not better. I ride a Harley Breakout and every where I ride people comment and want one. My bike is loud in fact very loud but I didn’t buy the helmet expecting it to drown out the noise of the engine nor do I intend to use to go across Australia. I do how ever love this helmet as a great alternative for around the city and small rides of a couple of hundred kms. If it is a sports bike style helmet you are after then this is not the helmet for you. As for breaking the helmet down into its smaller configuration does make you look like you have a mushroom on your head so I don’t see a lot a people doing that either.The look is great, vision is good size is true and I have to agree with other comments if you have a large beak you may struggle a bit at times getting it on.\n",

      "I loved this helmet since the moment I saw it on the web site. Bought it, and have worn it for about a season now. This helmet is comfortable and definitely gets a few looks. There are only two downsides though.1. The wind noise. The helmet isn't very streamlined around the sides of the visor, so it'll cause some nasty wind noise on the sides of the helmet. 2. If you want to install a Bluetooth headset you have to do a bit of surgery. The helmet features a soft strap cover with a leather backside for comfort. I had to make a small incision on the backside of the strap cover to slip the speakers into them since the helmet does NOT have proper ear holes. There are some holes you can put the speakers in, but they sit too far forward and are covered by the strap cover, so they cannot be heard that way.Other than these two things, I love the helmet. It came with two visors; One tinted, the other clear. When the visor is closed and the face mask is on, it seals good, so you cannot feel the wind as bad. There is a decent gap from your chin to the chin of the face mask. So much so that I cannot feel the microphone cover and I can easily scratch any itches without having to lift the visor. The gap also provides a nice airflow, not too much to be annoying. Nothing more than a gentle breeze.\n",

      "This helmet tries to do it all but just misses the mark. It really only looks good in the \"full face\" configuration. anything else, it looks like you are in the Air Force and you borrowed a work helmet to ride in. The noise in one word \"unbearable\". With ear plugs, it is just slightly less than deafening. As a \"half helmet\" it just looks weird with plenty of mushroom.The noise and buffeting above 50 MPH makes this thing just miserable. Around town, it is fine but don't buy this for any higher speed riding. Also noteworthy, this is only certified as a half helmet. The face mask is just for road debris protection.\n",

      "Unique Helmet\n",
      "Every helmet is unique.  I've purchased and had the chance to use this helmet for most of my summer riding.  I definitely think that for style, its a good looking helmet.  I agree with the video that it only looks silly when you wear it on its half shell configuration.  Every other configuration, full face and 3/4 configuration, style is great.  This is quite a loud helmet if you compare it to full face helmets.  That should be a given though since this is only rated as a half helmet.  It works well with me though since I get to enjoy listening to the music from my stereo.  On freeway speeds though, the wind noise could get irritating if you plan on going long distance with it.In terms of airflow, if used on full face configuration, the muzzle area circulates air well.  The top vents if anything circulate minimal air in my opinion.  There are no exhaust vents at the back of the helmet and may be the reason why I don't feel much circulation on my head.I love the fact that the helmet both comes with a detachable clear and tinted lens.  I haven't tried swapping them out yet so I cant comment on how easy it is to switch them.  The lens only has two settings, open or closed.  There are no vent/cracked settings for the lens so just be ready for either a full face or minimal amount of air to the face.  Find the best configuration that works with you and the weather.In terms of safety, I think nothing beats a full face rated helmet like the video suggests.  The muzzle and 3/4 extension portions are made of rubber material so I couldn't speculate on how durable they would hold up on an accident.I personally purchased this helmet for simple around town use and to enjoy the stereo I have on my motorcycle.  For that purpose, I think it does it well. I hope this review helped in some way.  Safe journeys!\n",

      "I've only had this helmet  a few weeks so far, but the three piece design has really come in handy. It feels well made, and the gel pad insert keeps my head very cool. I've mostly used it as a half helmet, so far. I love that I can change from one to the other. It's a good thing that my bike has large saddle bags though. The removed chin bar and back half take up a lot of space. But, I can store these pieces along with the face shield that I'm not using, in the provided helmet bag. I wish they had a photochromic shield for this, or at the very least a quick release, locking face shield. The clip on/pull off design leads me to believe that it would not hold up to any impact or prolonged use. In summary not everything that I hoped for, but just what I expected at this price point. I would definitely pay more, however if they were to address these issues.\n",

      "This helmet obviously has the looks and gets a lot of good comments on that subject. It fits good and has plenty of room but I am also used to wearing only full faced helmets. Sure, it has some noise issues but that is due mostly because of the lack of cheekpads and removable muzzle. Thats just how it is designed! I typically have in earplugs or earphones with music so I dont pay attention to the wind noise.I will say that improvements should be made with top ventilation. There isnt much airflow that moves over the top of your noggin! Also, the shield optics could use some better quality. Theyre a little cloudy but Im used to ICON shields.So, being realistic, this is not a highway speeds or long distance helmet and I experienced both but if you're riding with the crew or around town, youll get some extra looks and feel like MadMax!...of course mine has metal spikes and stickers all over it...\n",

      "Both my boyfriend and I have this helmet.  We've tried it all three ways.  It works great as a full-face helmet (and looks awesome as well), and it works well as a three-quarter helmet.  But when we took off both parts to use it as a half-helmet, it is completely useless.  Because the visor is situated far from the face, any wind causes the helmet to lift off the head.  And without the ear piece to keep the helmet on the head snugly, as a half-helmet it is loose and not secure.  Do not buy this if you are going to use it primarily as a half-helmet.\n",

      "OK, it looks cool in the video, but why dress for the ride, when you should dress for the slide?! This is the most dicey piece of cheap motorcycle gear I've seen in a while. The helmets are so cheap, the video editors add in foley so the \"clicks\" sound like it locks together with a loud clunk. That chin skirt is a cheap piece of rubbery plastic. GI Joe figures are built better. Not joking. Go see this in person at your local dealership and you'll see that it weighs like 1.5 lbs, it's WINDY, LOUD, about as thick as a piece of paper and you can't see anything through it. It fogs extremely easy. What a waste of money. You want a \"cool looking helmet\"? Get something that will make you look cool without having to explain to your family and doctor why you're also trying to recover from a missing face or brain injury. This is silly.\n",

      "I bouth this helmet based on a few things. First of all, I loved the look of it. After trying it on it does fit a little tighter than other helmets of the same size so if you are closer to the 7 1/2 you may need to go up to an XL. I also was really impressed with how easy it is to change out the visor. (It comes with a tinted visor and a clear one.) It's very comfortable for people with a more rounded head. A lot of narrower helmets give me a headache after wearing them for a while, not a problem with this one. I like the removable magnetic face shield as well. The helmet still looks good without it attached, but when you break it down into a half helmet, it looks bulky. The only thing that could be improved upon in my opinion is the noise. It is louder than my other helmets but not enough that I don't want to wear it. Hope this review helps. Stay safe.\n",

Now that being said, I tried one of these on and while it looks awesome and the drop down is nice with a good field of vision...the ears are incredibly uncomfortable as others have mentioned. I'm not sure what they were thinking with this, and I REALLY wanted to like it, but the area for your ears just won't do it for me. There is no real pockets. The padding cuts right across pushing against your ears and while some might be able to get used to it, I don't think I ever could. Everything else I love about this helmet. As I said I had a Raw so I know what to expect from a half and 3/4 helmet. I know this face shield is not CE rated but it will still keep crap off your face which is nice zipping around town. I couldn't see wearing this for long hwy rides however.\n",

But even in the video review, the normally nothing-but-positive observations of the staff reviewers on this site even note that though this appears like a full-face helmet it decidedly is not because that magnet-adhered chin piece will immediately come off once ANY contact with the asphalt is made. Still, it is a bad-ass LOOKING helmet. Offer it in an actually visible color, and I might throw caution (i.e. safety) to the wind and get one.\n",

It comes with a smoke shield that is mounted already and a clear shield in the box.  When I first put the helmet on it was a little tight around my jawline, which I attribute to it being new. I went for a ride (about an hour) to test out the helmet. On the bike (2015 Victory Highball), it really looks awesome and compliments my bike. A few minutes into riding I stopped at a light and another rider pulled up next to me and asked me where I got the helmet and what it is called. I told him Revzilla (you're welcome) and that it was the Scorpion Covert. He said \"that's *ucking badass!\"  The helmet is not heavy on and cuts the air really well. It is a little loud but I also have a Bell Rogue so I knew what I was getting with this helmet when I comes to noise level. The visor integrates perfect and blocks a ton of wind and bugs. It also has great airflow through the helmet. If you've never ridden with a helmet with the removable face shield you are going to think this helmet is noisy, but I'm used to it. I'm very happy with this helmet and will recommend it to those who like the removable face shield helmets. Thanks Revzilla.\n",

So i did and thats fine, glad i didnt have to send it in. Well a few weeks ago i noticed a crack next to the bolt and the other side bolt was loosening again and in doing the fixing part as i screwed in the pieces the plastic crumbled and i could not tighten it. I contacted scorpion again and they sent me brand new plastic pieces yay... well NOT yay... those brand new pieces broke where the screw goes in the first try in attaching to the helmet. Im waiting on them cuz i have to send it in and scorpion will attempt to fix it or give me a new helmet but thats taking forever on their part.

The only gripe I have is that something about the way it is made causes the chin guard insert to pop out on one side every time I take the helmet off. While the peak is removable, the helmet looks far better with the peak on. I have received a number of comments that it looks like something from Halo. Being able to open the front makes putting it on a breeze. And it has the ear holes so that speakers drop right into place for a bluetooth set. This is by far the best looking helmet I have owned in 30 years of riding.\n",

Ive got about 80 hours of ride time on the helmet in offroad conditions. I couldn't be happier with it. Still functions silky smooth. No real problems in the heat. Would be better if it had A/C. No complaints from me except the sizing.. size up and its great. Hope this helps the few of you that cant make up your mind. Its worth the money.\n",

      "Wanted an adventure style helmet (ride Tiger 800XCx) with good airflow and after a lot of research finally decided on the Scorpion. Arrived quickly. Put it on and gave it the standard chin bar test. It FAILED! The chin bar didn't catch at all on one side. Fiddled with it to realize the locking mechanism was bad. Contacted Scorpion and they sent me a new piece immediately. Disassembled the chin bar (pita) and put me mechanism in. Fixed. Went for a ride and discovered there was NO airflow. Fiddled with the liner as it didn't line up with air holes. Nope. I even cupped my hand by the head vents to try force more air, nothing.  Fit was good but eventually got a hot spot on my forehead.  Very hot day so head was sweating. No relief even with shield up since it was snug. Pulled over and put on old Kabuto helmet. Instantly felt the airflow on my head. No issues with the visor as far as drag or pulling the helmet but it was a little too high to block the late day sun. Noise was slightly above average. Also had to take helmet apart (liner out, foam out, etc.) to tighten chin bar posts as the were loose by the time I gave up on the helmet. With all the issues the store took it back. I would NOT recommend this helmet.\n",

The built in sun shade is an amazing feature too! Unfortunately I got to test the safety factor of the helmet when I locked up my front tire off-road and slid a couple feet on my head and shoulder.

Aside from the that, it's just an basic descent helmet.  The drop down visor is great.  It seem a little tight once you close the lid, but it very quickly becomes comfortable.  The moisture wicking material is good too.  The only con I can think of is the air flow is nothing special.  But for the price, it's totally worth it.\n",

      "This isn’t a review on how much I love this helmet. Its going to be about what minor inconveniences this helmet has. First off this helmet is a little tight around the cheek pads when the helmet is fully closed. I have an oval shaped head but a narrow chin so I suggest try one size up for you big headed people. Second, the sun visor honestly services no purpose besides giving the helmet a more complete look. It doesn’t block the sun in anyway and when riding on the freeway or at anything above 55 the visor creates a vibration slightly blurring your vision. Third, your main clean protective screen is slightly distorted at the top. It’s at the top of your visor and when you ride under anything over hanging the road you see the object in the top of the screen. Also the problem with the distortion it cause a really bad sun glare. Lastly when you open the top vent of the helmet, the wind noise increases. I use a sena system and turning up the volume just a little solves the problem. Overall i do really like this helmet. I highly recommend this helmet to any rider looking for a mid priced helmet.\n",

      "I've ridden with this helmet for about a year now.  The visor looks cool for adventure riders, but it isn't very functional.  At anything over 40 mph on road, it is vibrating all over the place.  That can actually be pretty distracting.  It also doesn't provide much shade from the sun when riding offroad.  It doesn't protrude very far to the front.  Luckily, the helmet still looks and works great after removing the visor.  The built-in flip-down shade is awesome.  No more squinting and tearing up because you forgot or broke your sunglasses.  I won't buy a helmet without that feature ever again.  It's fantastic.  The helmet is comfortable and has pretty good air flow control.  I've ridden with it comfortably in both hot and cold environments.The feature to flip up the front face mask has not been very useful to me.  It functions as intended, but I just don't find many occasions to use it.  I thought it would be nice when stopping to talk for a second with a buddy while riding, but the combination of the loud bikes and the fact that your ears are still totally covered prevent that from working.  I never find myself flipping that up.  However, having that feature doesn't seem to interfere with anything else.\n",

      "Remove the Duck Bll Visor\n",
      "The Scorpion EXO-AT950 is an acceptable helmet, but unfortunately, I had to remove the Visor, which is exactly the reason i bought it!  I wanted a modular helmet with a visor, and the only other choice is the Schuberth, which is twice as expensive. BUT the vibration and the noise was so bad from the visor on this helmet, that i could not even hear my custom fit ear buds. Any speed over 50 mph was a significant problem. Once I removed the visor, however, the noise and vibration went away.The visor is thin and not very substantial plastic, which of course is easily subject to the wind.  I have tried using zip ties to stiffen it and dampen the vibration, to no avail.   I may try filling the underside with some body putty filler or JB Weld to stiffen it and give it some weight, which will dampen the vibration, but may cause it to be unbalanced  or be too heavy. But at this point, I can't run the visor at road speed and will try putting it back when I head off-road. My bike is an ADV with a windshield, so I would expect the noise and vibration to be worse without a windshield.\n",

I run OSHA approved ear plug/ear buds, and they do fit under this helmet Visibility is excellent, and being able to flip up the front of the helmet at gas stops is very nice.The drop down sun visor is good, but like most drop down visors, you still need to get a smoked visor for really bight days.\n",

      "Bought this for a ride from Eagle River, AK to Tuktoyaktuk and back,via Denali Hwy, this past July. The visor makes a whining noise, it’s annoying, so i took it off and the internal sun shade does the job keeping the sun out. It did not pull my head around too much at speed (KLR650 can’t go that fast).I love the modular functionality, this is my second modular helmet. The button is easily usable with gloves. I don’t like that I can’t put the chin bar down with one hand without slamming it down. If I use one hand on the back of the helmet, holding it down,the. I can close it with the other hand and hear the click of the lock. I put a Sena10 Bluetooth in it and it kept the noise out enough to hear music and a fellow rider. I was still able to fog the face shield up when in about 40 degrees and high humidity, it was raining on and off. Some dishwashing liquid helped, but not much. I also kept forgetting to clean the sun shield when I cleaned the face shield, since it was flipped up out of the way. I rode with eyeglasses and even with sun shield down, had no problems. Just make sure you have thin earpiece stems to fit between cheek pads and your head. And bring a spare pair in case you damage them putting them on with helmet on. Love the looks of the flat black. Wore a buff underneath and didn’t have a problem with pinching or sore spots. Overall, a great value!\n",

Some things i didn't like so much were that the visor seemed like it was designed for looks instead of function as it doesn't go down/out at an angle that does much good blocking the sun, and it isn't adjustable. Also, accidentally dropped it on its top once and the top vents detent broke so it just fluttered between open/close at high speeds, Kinda my fault but i felt that vent was pretty chincy from the start. Few days later I hit a deer and high sided the bike, and landed pretty hard on the pavement and this thing kept me safe - i hit my head pretty hard and slid a short distance. I didn't get so much as a headache afterwards, but i did break my collarbone and other things so i'd say this helmet does its intended purpose very well! It still works, just scratched up a bit but i've since gotten another different helmet, since it's \"unsafe\" to keep wearing the one i crashed in...

      "I bought this helmet last July and have ridden with through some pretty hot Arizona days at 110+ degrees. While I haven't had the helmet in temps below 53. I feel like its been put through enough that I can finally leave a review. I've worn nothing but Icon street helmets over the last 9 years and so moving into a different helmet maker with wasn't met without some trepidation. The peak on the helmet worried me the most, with the possibility of it catching a lot of wind on the highway and yanking my head around, not to mention the noise levels associated with those speeds. The helmet is awesome. I ride a 2018 Africa Twin ATAS. At 6'4 I find the buffeting a lot less that I expected from the peak at highway speeds. I find that on the bike on the long slab sessions I can look around and move my head at will with out any serious wind pull. I had more buffeting from my old icon than I do from this helmet. One of the best features of this helmet IMO is the fact that its modular chin bar. Sitting in traffic when its 110+ its nice to be able to flip up the chin bar and breathe a little more air than what you get inside the helmet. It actually makes riding on those days a little more bearable. Airflow is good and while I still sweat its nothing compared to my helmets of old. As for the noise in the helmet, I attached my Sena 20s to the helmet and even with music on I still feel that the helmet keeps the \"at speed\" noise to a bearable level. I can hear my podcasts and music without having to jam the Sena to volume level 11.  Even at speed without music the helmet is quiet and non-headache inducing.\n",

      "Great Helmet, Fantastic Value, Slight Fit Issue\n",
      "I'm no helmet expert, but I'd had a few, and read a lot, and tried on many. The AT-950 is a HUGE bang for the buck.  I demo'd the Shoei Neotec II and choose the AT-950.  That tells you a lot!The most important thing for me to say is that like others, I found the cheekpads too tight.  Overall I feel the helmet is true to size, I measure a medium and bought a medium knowing it would fit too snug at first, but then pack down a bit. It's perfect after a month or so.  I'm glad I did not upsize as some do.  BUT, the cheekpads really squeezed me chipmonk style when you shut the chin bar (if that's what it's called).  So, I bought the Large cheekpads (which are thinner than medium, i.e., for a large helmet) and now the fit is perfect.  I feel like I got a custom size just for me!  THANKS TO GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM REVZILLA.  They resolved this for me.  So, don't buy a larger size if you can solve the fit issue with cheekpads.  Other stuff:  very quiet with vents closed, and I bought it for cooler weather so it's fine to run with closed vents for me. The latch, visor, everything works perfect.  I also bought the dark smoke visor, so I didn't have to wear sunglasses - I highly recommend this.  The viewport is fantastic - you can see how it is cut-away down low, this is very helpful on my bike.  I ride a Suzuki Burgman 650 Exec, basically a touring sitting position, upright.  I like the cutaways in the viewport so I can see my mirrors and instruments.  Oh, the little plastic visor peak thing? Forget that unless you never go faster than 20 mph :) I took it off, no loss.  Overall, I am VERY pleased with this, especially for the price, you can't beat it.  It's my fav helmet, basically blows away others I've owned.\n",

      "I love this helmet. I wear it almost every day. I've ridden about 15,000 miles in it so far through five countries. I'm from the States but live on an island off the coast of Honduras. It's hot and humid here. I'll get my main gripe out of the way: ventilation sucks. I can't really feel any difference with the tiny top vent open or closed. Worse, it's the same with the chin vent. This seems like it would be such an easy problem to fix! That being said, I've enjoyed the helmet while touring around Central America. It's my first modular helmet but the noise level seems fine to me. While touring, I ride with ear buds. The flip down sun shield and the removable visor are awesome. Some say the stock sun shield is too light. I thought so too at first. I just did 2000 miles in the States on a Gold Wing and decided to ride with my glasses instead of my normal setup of contact lenses and sunglasses. I used the sun shield and got used to it very quickly. Only occasionally did I wish for a darker tint. The helmet has held up very well in the year and a half I've owned it. In the Tropics, the heat, humidity, and salty air shorten the life of just of about everything. So far the helmet is holding up very well to daily use and abuse. I'm especially pleased with the liner. I wash it occasionally and that keeps it from getting funky. So far it's not flaking or pilling or falling apart, like they tend to do down here. The face shield doesn't tend to fog and I've ridden in some torrential downpours. The modular design is soooooo convenient for touring for many obvious reasons. The best benefit though is when you get caught in crazy Latin American traffic jams -- you just flip up the front and get breezy relief from the heat as you ride down the sidewalk past all the cars! I buy a new helmet every few years. If Scorpion addresses the ventilation, I will buy this helmet again!\n",

      "I've had this helmet about a week now.  Commute has been 40F in the morning and 70F in the afternoon.  Good airflow.  Excellent vision.  I've been unable to get the visor to fog even when I'm trying too!  That's pretty impressive.  The fit on my cheeks is a little tight.  I should be able to buy the next size up cheek pads and loosen it up a bit.  Unfortunately they are out of stock everywhere!  Hopefully that will be solved soon.Thing I'd do differently if I ruled the world.Inner visor should be darker,Quick release chin strap.  Double D ring is so annoying.  That's about it.  I love everything else about this helmet.  The visor is awesome, the latching mechanism is awesome, the hold open when the chin bar is up is awesome.  Detent with visor cracked is good, if a little wide.  Padding is good.  Space for helmet comm system is perfect.  Very impressed.Maybe it's a little heavy?  I'm really reaching for problems.

They've discontinued the specific liners as well, so it's kind of a bummer. I've been riding for a week now and here are my likes and dislikes:Likes:Sick design, plenty of airflow, nice color options, that's about it.Dislikes: The face shield DOES fog up with glasses on colder days.

      "Seems too Loud\n",
      "I bought this helmet based on the reviews.  It looks great and seemed like the perfect helmet for my new KLR.  I had two full face helmets at my house one too large and over 13 yrs old.  Based on online sizing  my head measured for a medium size.  That was so tight I could barely get it on and then it was very painful by my ears and horrible pressure by my cheeks.  I then changed for a large.  It fit better everywhere but still have lots of pressure on my cheeks.  I am being told that area will break in.   My first ride with the AT950 was very loud.  All I heard was a crazy loud wind noise echoing inside.  No way I could ride for hours like that.   I assumed it was the visor so I took it off and took another ride.  Noise level was the same so it  is not the visor.  I am driving under 55mph and my KLR is stock.  I tried different riding positions to see if getting low behind wind shield helped.  It did not.  The lower I was the more it sounded hollow and echoed.  When I put my head above the windshield the echoing was less but still loud from wind.  I also tried closing all vents....same noise level.  With a full face helmet I don't notice any noise and could easily talk on bluetooth headset.  With the new AT950 modular helmet there is no way I could  hold a conversation unless I was going  25mph or less.   I would love for it to be operator error but I can't see how that can be.\n",

      "Too hot for Houston Summers\n",
      "I've owned this helmet for about 9 months, ridden it in rain and blistering heat, and overall its a decent helmet let down by a few things. The Good: I love the internal sun visor. It comes down far enough that it shades the eyes well without obscuring the bikes gauges. The flip-up chinbar works well too, and switching between the peak visor and the supplied side covers only takes a coin and a couple of minutes of your time.The Bad: The peak visor is pretty much useless. You can see maybe a 1/2 inch of it in the top of your field of vision. It's non-adjustable, so cant be lowered either. I've also noticed a weird thrumming noise when I have the peak visor on and get above 60 mph. Not really bad, but annoying. Also, you'll need earplugs. It's quieter than my old HJC at speed, but I think jet engines were also quieter than that bucket.The Ugly:The venting... Open vents, closed vents, all feels about the same. Stuck in traffic on Houston streets in August, and my head will literally begin too melt. I feel like one of those Salvador Dali paintings. So I open the face shield until traffic starts to move, then close it again so the inevitable dust and debris from the never ending road constructions doesn't end up inside the helmet.All in all, its a good spring, winter and fall helmet. But it needs more venting and an adjustable peak to go from good to great.\n",

      "Probably no such thing as a perfect helmet but i like it. Same as everyone the cheek pads are tight! If you wear glasses it is not as nice to use. Taking off or putting on the helmet with the glasses is a little tricky compared to others i have had. Easier taking helmet off with glasses on then putting helmet on with glasses on. I will eventually do a slight mod to the padding so the padding is not holding my glasses while riding. Just need to sew it a bit thinner right where the frames go back to the ears. That will help a bunch. Otherwise i like it and there don't seem much chance of finding a perfect helmet anyways. This is the closest i have found yet and after a slight mod should be great!\n",

If I didn't have a tool to tighten it it could have been a real problem as the face shield would not have locked in place without it. After tightening it , it never gave me a problem again\n",

      "My advice when buying any Scorpion helmet is to at least try one on first, because they all seems to fit pretty narrow. Aside from that it feels great - there are so many ways to catch good air flow with this helmet. My favorite thing about the helmet is how wide the vision area is - I can see a lot more to my left and right even when my head is straight. Plus it doesn’t feel heavy at all.

      "Purchased the helmet for ease of use and practicality when doing daily riding. The modular works well when crossing the border and the built in shade works well when it’s a bright morning commute before the sun is fully up.  There was is room to fit sunglasses with the shade down and no discomfort of sunglasses arms digging in, which I find with my Aria. Even though the visor looks cool I’m not sure of how useful it is... especially with the built in shades blocking the sun when needed. I noticed the visor also has an annoying creaking noise when travelling at speed when I’m not using ear plugs. I’m not sure if this a fastener issue or the plastic flexing under tension. Either way I removed the visor because of this. The general venting is pretty no existent and the mouth vent does very little. I spend most of my time opening the full screen. The visibility is outstanding and is more along the dirt bike style. All in all this is a good helmet. The padding is comfortable and firm and there are no pressure points. It would have been nice to have a quick release clip instead of the D rings, but it being a modular negates this with flipping the face to speak. I’ve hung up my full face Aria for the summer as this lid works well in many areas.\n",

What a helmet! The sun visor came in especially handy given the number of tunnels in the Alps. Come up to a dark tunnel, flip up the sun visor. Stop to take a beautiful photo, lift the chin bar and take a photo or take a drink. The ONLY thing that this helmet needs is a proper Pinlock insert, which I have ordered thru Revzilla!\n",

      "I've had this helmet for a few months now and feel it deserves a review after 2000 miles. Over all I really love the helmet but there are a few things that annoy me about it. I purchased this helmet in December so first few rides in cold Pennsylvania winter were ok. Before I put the sun visor on the screws fell out. Stoped into revzilla and they said to contact scorpion. There replacement screws were out of stock at the time. I put it off for a while as the helmet still functioned as long as I didn't open the face shield all the way. Eventually I called scorpion and in 2 minutes I had a new set of screws in the mail free of charge. Fast forward to spring and summer sun visor is now installed and I've been out on some long rides. My biggest issue is the noise and buffeting at higher speeds. A larger windshield may fix some of this but even at lower speeds the helmet is fairly loud. At highway speeds it actually hurt my ears. I dont ride a lot of highway so it's not a deal breaker but I'd rather not deal with it when I do.  Next complaint is the ventilation. In short I with it had more. It's not horrible but not great either. The face shield intervals are very wide. So cracking it just a little doesn't really happen. Overall it's a great helmet that I will continue using. Especially after the easy of dealing with scorpion over the phone and there friendly and helpful staff. The helmet looks great and i love having the modular helmet to grab a drink without having to take off the helmet at quick stops and fuel ups. It's very comfortable and fits well.  The price was also very reasonable for the quality of helmet.\n",

      "Only issue I had when I bought one unfortunately not from Revzilla because I found a slightly cheaper one elsewhere was a slight distortion on the face shield. I thought nothing of it until I went for one ride, which also happened to be in the rain (have to love Mississippi weather) and was just impossible to get a good view. I contacted Scorpion directly via phone call and was told a new face shield was on the way. However I only experience slight fogging from the inner sun visor while riding and once I opened the front vent down one more it quickly defogged. This has a noticeable amount of airflow from my last helmet which was a bell revolver. Easy to find controls for opening the front of the helmet. My glasses which are prescription fit amazing in this helmet. My Sena unit was a breeze to install even if you have to watch the mic a little with the chin mesh installed. Slight amount of noise on the sides not much more than my previous helmet. I know my Sena apparently gets picked up much more clearly now in this helmet and my music seems louder from the speakers so possibly a better seal all the way around. It's a little heavy but it's great to have the convenience to just open up the helmet for short conversations like if you wanted to run in the store grab something and walk out like a gas station. My only gripes beside the film or whatever distortion was on the face shield is that it will not fit in the frunk of the NC700x I guess it is just slightly larger than most full face helmets so I have to keep it on the outside of the bike now. Overall a great helmet and I'm happy to own one now.\n",

      "I wanted to get a modular, dual sport helmet to take on a 24,000 mile ride from Alaska to Argentina that commences in July 2018. I have broken the helmet in with maybe 3 hours of wearing it at home (break in cheek pads) and 12 hours or so riding thus far (light rain at 53F to bright sun and 100F; crawling in traffic to way, way fast speeds); these are my observations to date:PROS: Everything about the helmet feels solid and well built, and the field of view is huge. The cheek pads were very tight at first (top of helmet fit my head fine), and only took 3-5 hours to break in and begin to fit well; I would say true to size. The peak is not adjustable, but seems to be set in a good spot to block the sun with just a slight head tuck (it sticks out into your field of view). I wear earplugs, but do not find this helmet louder than my non-modular full face standard (Bell) helmet, it’s actually maybe a tad quieter. It seems to flow air just fine and I have not experienced fogging issues thus far (whereas I do with my Bell). The drop down visor works fluidly, and even with my light sensitive blue eyes, it appears to be dark “enough”…would be nice to be just a touch darker. I have not noticed the peak pulling my head overly strongly when doing head checks.CONS: The helmet is a bit heavy, though all of the helmets in this category (which are few) seem to weight about the same plus of minus one or two tenths of a pound. I am already getting used to the weight, though it will obviously be more tiring than a lighter helmet on a long ride.This will vary with every bike’s windscreen/wind flow configuration, but on a 2018 Multistrada, the peak begins to vibrate at about 45 mph if my head is slightly tilted down. I can stop the vibration by leveling my head or looking up slightly. The vibration, though fairly strong and constant, is not “too” bothersome given all else, and seems to get no worse with speed, even very high speed (in fact, the faster one goes it seems to reduce it, but that means going “very” fast). One can easily remove the peak of course, though I have not ridden with it in that configuration yet.All in all a great relative value for a well built, full featured modular DS helmet. If it were a half-pound lighter and the peak more all-around aerodynamic, it would be a steal at this price.\n",

      "Honest, long term review - No hype- These things have serious design flaws\n",
      "Everyone likes to rave about these helmets, but they have some obvious flaws that they simply should not have. I put about 5,000 miles on the past few months this winter. 1: The internal sun shield is ridiculous. Whatever mechanism they use is just sad. The visor literally rattles around inside the helmet on anything but the smoothest road. It's very loud. Sometimes it bounces around so much you can actually see it bouncing in and out of your field of vision. Honestly, it's laughable.2: Also with the internal sun shield is the fact that it's crooked. The notch for your nose is off-center. At least mine is. One the left side, it hits my nose....on the right side I can fit a finger between the notch and my nose. That's just poor QC. 3: The main visor and chin vent leak horribly. I mean..horribly. Since these are available in a dual lens version I thought this would make a good cold weather helmet. Nope. The forehead vent closes well, but the visor and chin vent leak so bad that I often end up with ice forming on the inside surface of my Pinlock and my chinbar. Really, that's just inexcusable. Luckily, my Revit balaclava is amazing, so it makes this helmet usable. It's not ear piercing, but the main visor whistles at speed due to leaking. Finger pressure cures it, but I'm not gonna ride around holding my visor against it's gasket... 3: The sun beak is useless. It's merely a fashion statement. You cannot see the beak when you are wearing the helmet, so it obviously can't block any sun ( or roost) if it's that short. How did that get past R&D? If it was 1/2\" longer it'd actually have a reason to exist.4: The chinbar is so close to your face that you cannot remove the helmet with the curtain installed unless you use the modular function. The opening is just too small to fit your head through. I thought that  perhaps they did this to manage wind, but everything else leaks so badly that I don't think that's the case. It's just a very odd, poorly made opening. The helmet is extremely comfortable and makes for a great street helmet. The padding feels top notch and it's really pretty quiet for what it is. I don't even wear earplugs with this helmet. The chin strap is great and the modular aspect works flawlessly. The sunshield tint/color is spot on. Both visors are optically correct and give a great field of view. But the rattly sun shield and leaky vents make what could be an AWESOME helmet feel very cheap and flimsy when you ride in it. My LS2 Pioneer helmet blows this Scorpion helmet away in every category (except the LS2 vents aren't closeable at all...grrr.)...at less than half the price. I wanted this to be the cold weather helmet to compliment my LS2 used for hot weather, but I think I'd rather just tape my Pioneer vents shut than listen to this helmet rattle, leak and whistle constantly. I bought my helmet second hand for $200 NIB. If I had ordered it new I would have returned it immediately. I still feel like I overpaid. Sorry, Scorpion, that's just how it is...\n",

      "I bought this to upgrade from my G-Max GM54S. I wanted to get a modular helmet with an internal sun visor but my options were limited due to using a helmet mounted Bluetooth. The controls for most internal visor modular helmets are where the Bluetooth would normally mount. This helmet had them on the left side near the visor hinge with the control moving back to drop the visor and forward to raise it. This lets it work with my Bluetooth. I use a Cardo Scala Rider G9.This helmet does well in all seasons. During the summer the main visor is frequently either wide open or open to the first notch for airflow with the sun visor provided an air pocket around my eyes. For the winter I installed the chin curtain and that was enough to keep most of the cold air out of the helmet.I think this helmet is pretty quiet for a modular but I also wear earplugs all the time which drastically cuts down on wind noise. My major gripe with this helmet as why it doesn't get 5 stars is the visor doesn't have an \"ever so slight cracked\" position. Supposedly the chin vent will defog the visor but with my tall windshield, it doesn't get sufficient airflow to do this. So before buying the pinlock visor and insert I had to either deal with the fogging or open the visor to the first notch which let in a significant amount of air.I've had this helmet for a year now and it has held up well. I expect it to continue to stand up to my riding.\n"

      "Great price for a modular - good look\n",
      "I used this Helmet for over a year and while It's a very nice helmet what I found most annoying is that the cheeks apply quite a bit of pressure. I understand that this is because it doesn't have the same padding as standard full faced (more on that later), but it creates some discomfort and fatigue over long rides.  The small up to large is apparently the same body but with different padding so if you where a small or medium you can swap out the padding in order to possibly avoid the pressure. The idea is the larger you go, the padding is slightly thinner until you get to the XL/L The XL uses a different body than the Large so once you hit large you are stuck with that padding unless you want to go even tighter. Note: I love any helmet with the internal visor. I find myself riding with the shield in the up position and the internal visor down most of the time.Now this is the biggest thing to note about open face and modular helmets (I learned the hard way). You don't have the same protection on the front of the helmet. I learned this when I cam in contact with a rather large boulder and the front of my face impacted the inside of the helmet. It made a pretty big mess inside that helmet. I came out fairly unscathed but I don't think I will get another modular helmet for that reason alone. Other than that I found this helmet to be nice for it's price point. It's a bit heavy and a bit noisy but there is plenty of room inside for mounting speakers. I found they never touched my ears like the 'inexpensive' Bilt Adventure helmet where I had constant rubbing from the same speakers installed in that helmet. It drove me nuts.Hope this information is useful\n",

Windscreen stays fog-free in the rain pretty well and the price point is definitely the thing that will get people to give this helmet a shot.I ride all year round and probably wouldn't use it in the winter due to the great air flow.All in all a great buy and I love it!\n",

      "Over all I like it\n",
      "Over all I like this helmet, sizing is the same as my non modular Scorpian helmet.  It's comfortable, it does fog up a little, usually opening the vents will take care of the fog.  I find that when flipping down you have to check if it's latched before riding off.  Several times it hasn't latched the first time.  I can't wear the visor above 62mph.  After that it feels like my eyes are guna rattle out.  It also has kind of a graphics layer on it.  It scratches easier than my other Scorpian.  Also the vents don't do as much as I was hoping.  I really like having a modular.  Was great for a month in Thailand.  I really like the large field of view(even though I don't wear goggles)  It's a good looking helmet(mines neon green) that appears to be quality.  One thing I never considered when shopping was the flip down sun shade, I love it and it's easy to use with gloves on.   When worn wet/raining it doesn't get as much of a mildew smell as other helmets I have worn.  I've worn this helmet for 4hrs a day several times, it remains comfortable. From heat, humidity and rain in Thailand to 50 degrees in California mountains it worked.  If I had it to do again I would try a bunch of other modulars and forget the visor.  If you consider you can't wear the visor anyway there are a lot of other options out there I'd look at prior to purchase.  I might even buy it again even knowing the visor doesn't work.  It just kinda makes me mad that I bought it for the visor I can't use.  I'm kinda curious if my head wobble issues are related to what I ride and height of windshield?  If the V-Stroms windshield just puts the stream of air at a bad spot for this helmet???\n",

      "Great Helmet Great Features Not Perfect\n",
      "So far I really like this helmet.  It's got all the great features and style I was looking for in a price range I could afford.Fit on my head was perfectly snug, but the cheek pads took a while to break in before they would be considered comfortable.  I don't know if a size up would be better or worse because I may be too loose on the top of my head.The stock visor fogs up real bad in the rain.  Maybe not the first rain, but after that it is strait up dangerous.  You need to upgrade to the pinlock visor or use some sort of anti-fog solution.I like having the peak on the helmet, because it looks cool and actually helps shade the eyes when the sun starts getting low.  You don't notice it at 55mph, but when you get up 70+ it can grab the wind a bit.  It's not too bad really but if you get caught behind something creating some choppy air, this may be exaggerated by the peak.  Not enough to be dangerous, just uncomfortable.I put in a Sena 20S.  The helmet has nice spaces for it to fit nicely.  I had to wrestle the liners back in for a while on my helmet before everything was back in place where it should be.The noise level is quieter than my old Nolan N90 even when this helmet has the peak in place.  So I guess this would be basically average for a noise level in the wind.Awesome looking helmet.\n",

      "Great quality for price\n",
      "As most have said, the price and look are what I found most appealing about this helmet. I used to wear a 3/4 helmet, so a modular was a nice upgrade.First things first, be careful if you wanted this helmet with a dark visor. Scorpion is between distributors at the moment, so there is virtually no supply of dark visors or cheek pads available.The helmet fit securely. I was between an XL and XXL size-wise, and the XL fit me everywhere great except the cheek pads. I managed to find a pair on e-Bay and buy them, and once the XXL pads were in, it was even more comfortable.The \"anti-fog\" shield is lacking, in my opinion. It doesn't fog all the way up, but at the bottom of the shield I definitely notice moisture build up. This is with all vents open, mind you. So it's necessary to open the shield when you are stopped.I'm very pleased with the look, I get plenty of compliments on it, and it keeps my head warm for the cold seasons without much wind noise. I recommend removing the sun peak, as I noticed it fighting me once I was over 50 mph or so.\n",

      "Admittedly, the only thing I have to compare it to is my first helmet, an bottom-shelf HJC from the local shop. It's airy in side, and comfortable. The combination of flip-down sunshade and the peak on the top both help a lot when dealing with the sun. The flip-up chin bar, being able to talk to people on demand, kept me from being mugged on the bike just yesterday. I was worried about the peak on top catching the air and yanking my head around, but it hasn't been an issue, the wide profile in cross-winds is more noticeable. A great set of features that I've only seen in helmets that are way more expensive. The visibility and the clarity of the visor keep surprising me, sometimes I can't tell if it's open or closed. Only complaint is that the chin bar thing is so big I have to look turn my head to see the speedometer.\n",

      "I bought this helmet to replace my old Fly Trekker helmet. It is definately quieter than the Fly Trekker but the fit, which was snug at the beginning has worn into a slightly loose fit now. At the end of a day of riding I feel like it is slightly loose on my head as the cushioning settles in. I find myself always tugging on the chin strap to see if it is snug because it feels looser than what I am used to and the helmet shifts quite a lot on my head when lifting or closing the chin bar.I wasn't sure how I would like the internal/built in sun shades but have found them to be useful and handy to have when needed. I wish the sun visor was slightly longer and it does vibrate a bit when riding at higher speeds...guess this is why they made it fairly easy to remove. I do like the modular build and think it is worthwhile to have in order to get more air on my face at stops and to be able to eat/drink without taking the helmet off if stopped for a short time .THe field of vision is not as wide/open as the Fly Trekker but I don't seem to notice it when I'm riding now...it was noticeable when I first tried it on though...guess I got used to it.Overall I'm pleased with the helmet but if I were to do it again I think I'd try a size smaller although it did give me a headache due to pressure on my forehead when I wore it the first time. That hot spot seems to have adjusted to my head and no longer causes pain.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet this past summer and thought it may be my be all end all for ADV helmets.  Well after riding for three days in the fall weather, the helmet has fallen out of favor for me and I am now looking for something else.  The helmet has two issues that have only become apparent in the fall weather where the sun is low in the sky.  1)  The flip down sun visor is not dark enough in bright sun. 2)  The peak/visor is an absolute joke.   You won't realize it until you need it, but the peak/visor is placed so high that it is 95% ineffective  With the helmet mounted, you can see maybe 1/4\" of visor sticking into your view.  This makes is worthless for it's design intent.  The visor needs to stick out into your vision at least an inch or it does no good.  Combine item #2 with item number 1 when are you riding into the low autumn sun and the helmet is far from the correct option.If you buy this helmet plan on removing the peak/visor as it does nothing but add turbulence.  Yeah it looks cool but if it were 1\" lower down it would actually be functional.Anyone know of an ADV helmet with a flip down sunscreen and peak/visor that actually works?  I can give up the modular design but the first two items are a must.Greg\n",

      "Everytime I see a helmet that I like I'm too late to the party and. It is sold out and discontinued for the rest of human time! I saw the Scorpion EXO-AT950, read the reviews, watched some YouTube reviews, and bought it. I have a 2017 Harley Softail Slim-S FLSS, and this helmet makes it look like I stole my bike straight from the battlefield. I am a Wounded Veteran so I love the distressed camp look. My review will cover Product Perceptability / Ease of Attachments / Fit & Feel / Communications Mods. If you don't want to read the whole review, my BLUF: Buy it now while you still can! PRODUCT PERCEPTABILITY  (i.e. is it what I thought it would look like?) Better than expected. Just as awesome when I pulled it out of the box as it looked online. The colors were spot on. EASE OF ATTACHMENTS:I am always worried I am going to scratch or break something right after I get it out of the box, so I am always super careful. The only thing they didn't tell you in the directions is that when you put on the peak visor they have little rubber covering over the male-end tips on the visor, those need to be removed before attaching the visor. The screw are basically flat head but you are supposed to use a coin (quarter or nickel works well).  That's brilliant because if you are on a ride and want to add the visor or take it off you don't have to go to Home Depot. You can wear this helmet like 10 different ways. This is the way all helmets should be organized. The built in sun glasses are awesome. I only use them with full face and clear visor down, otherwise my eyes get dry, but that's just my own personal preference. Your stupid if you are using the built in sun glasses when it's dark, unless you bought the yellow HD lenses to put in its place on their website, so I'm not even going to comment on visibility with the built in sun glasses at night. FIT &  FEEL: I am 6'3\" around 225 and my noggin isn't that big, but I was towards to maximum end of the spectrum for the L / minimum end of the spectrum for the XL. I went with the XL, and was I did! I was worried about the built in sun visor being too close to my cheeks. I recommend using the minimum spectrum to judge what size you should get. If you are towards the middle or end of the spectrum go up a size. The padding is more than sufficient and will be uncomfortable otherwise. Another thing, and there is plenty of warning on this so no one should be surprised. The helmet is more on the heavy side. When I was setting up phone to the Bluetooth comms. I was looking down a lot at my phone, and within 5 min my neck was aching. But I was sitting in my couch doing that, any other time I am looking at the road and am fine. You might have a little neck ache the first couple of times you wear it, but you'll build us those muscles in your neck. Besides no girl wants a pencil-neck pipsqueak, you'll thank them later. COMMUNICATIONS MODS:I added the Sena 10R to my helmet. They did a great job placing the speaker cutouts for this helmet. The sound is clear, quiet, and amazing. The side unit went on well, but because of the contour of the back of the helmet the battery pack for the back covers part of the DOT sticker. I don't condone covering the sticker because it may be illegal in some states. I left as much of the sticker visible without compromising the back decals and the overall look of the helmet.Overall 10 out of 10.  Guaranteed to get you more chick's, you'll be able bench press more, and you'll be able to grow your beard 10X faster. Be careful though, you might get into more old timey bare knuckle boxing matching matches, after purchasing this helmet.\n",

      "The jack of all trades\n",
      "I'm writing this review as a previous open face helm user and new street rider. As I began racking up the miles road debris/rain and wind noise started to become a concern on longer rides since I'm on a naked bike. So I began searching for something with a more protection from the above. At first I was interested in the 3/4 helmet style like the Drak helm but liked the better wind protection/style of a full face. This brought me to modular helmets and finally the AT950. Which seemed to be the best of both worlds so I took the plunge.Comfort/Fit: The first thing I noticed trying the helmet on was that it was a tighter fit. However I don't mean that in a negative way but that this helmet has more/better padding/protection then my open face helm. I knew I would need to adjust and once I did it's not noticeable anymore. It's a solid fitting helm none the less. Style/Shape:As you know the \"peak\" of the helm is removable and it was the very first thing I did. I use the helm exclusively for street riding so I prefer the look/style. Once removed the helmet looks like a normal full faced helm. Do to it's modular design the helms shape is abit bigger but it's not a deal breaker considering all other features.Features:The main reason I bought this helmet. It literally does everything I need it too. Unlike my open face helm where I had to put on my goggles/helm and could only really adjust them at a stop, the AT950 is the opposite. All these things are in one helm from the get go. If I need protection from the sunlight I can drop down the sun visor with a simple push of the button. When I need ventilation I just pop the top open and pull down the mouth vent (Or keep closed on colder days). When stopped for getting gas for instance I use the flip up chin bar for air/visibility without removing the helm. This is also made better thanks to the anti-fogging EverClear visors. So your vision is never compromised.Vision: I thought this would be one of the toughest parts transitioning to the closed style helm. However, thanks to the AT950's wide viewing angle this wasn't an issue like I initially thought it would be. This combined with the EverClear visors I mentioned above and you can see why visibility is so good. Noise Level/Air Flow:Being a modular helm noise flow may not be as quiet as a full face helm but coming from an open helm style cut down on the air flow blowing directing on/into my ears. Wind noise has however been reduced enough to no longer be an issue. What's great is thanks to the adjustable vents you can still get great air flow without the cost of too much wind noise (Or you can just close them to make your ride quieter).Weight:This one will vary from person to person but I honestly don't find the helmet too heavy. However, I'm sure if I tried a full face/light weight helm that may change but I don't have an issue with the weight of the helm as is. In closing:It was thanks to all these features that made the transition from an open face style that much smoother and for it's price it was a no-brainer purchase. So hopefully this review helps some of you who are on the fence about trying a modular style helmet. 10/10 for me!P.S. RevZilla, thanks for the service! You guys rock!\n",

      "Great helmet, tons of features\n",
      "This is a great helmet with a ton of features for the money.The biggest concern I had was finding a helmet that had a good field of view. I have two separate gauge pods on my bike (2009 VMAX), one up by the handlebars and another on top of the tank. With this helmet I barely have to move my head to see the bottom gauges, it hardly interferes with your vision at all. It's very comfortable, though a little tight in the cheeks, it still isn't broken in yet. I took the top part off and the helmet looks great. With a black visor I get looks everywhere I go.Airflow is great on the face vent, though the top vent doesn't seem to do a whole lot. Regardless, I haven't had any complaints with the helmet being too hot and I live in Houston where it's hot and humid all the time.Wind noise isn't bad at all. I can wear a set of cheap earbuds and listen to music at a reasonable volume and barely hear the wind at all.I'd highly recommend it to anyone on the fence about it.\n",

What you get in return for the venting and long front is a tremendous amount of noise coming into the helmet.  There is significant room at the chin for road noise and wind.  It really is distractingly loud.  The build quality is in the range of what you would expect from this price.  It's not impressive but seems solid.  If you really want the looks, great visibility, visor, and modularity of this helmet then you have to accept road noise.  Get ear plugs or play your music loud...\n",

Second  it's louder then I want. Third the beak catches the wind over 55. Other than that it's great , it breaths well, the beck is perfect and with the drop down sun shades I don't need sunglasses. the modular face works great other than its kinda in the way of my Gopro  placement.

      "The first thing to say is that this helmet saved me from serious injury when I t-boned an SUV at 40 mph. It took 3 hits (faceshield hit my windshield, right front hit the side of the SUV, back hit the pavement) and I came through it with no head injury. It's light weight, and the field of view is very good. On the con side, it could use more ventilation, and I found it wildly optimistic to say that the face shield won't fog. I tried to use the optional visor but found it to noisy. If you have a long oval shaped head, order at least one size up or it will be too tight. This is more a function of my head shape than any fault with the helmet.\n",

      "The brain bucket is great!! Ditto, ditto, ditto to all the other praises about this thing! Except for these three things... 1) Give me air! Ventilation with visor down is it's weakest feature. It's killing me in Florida summer behind my Triumph Explorer windshield. But even on a naked Thruxton the air is minimal. Throw in a another vent or two and you have a winner. 2) The sun-peak bolts up against the front visor. This is a plastic on plastic sandwich. At speeds over 35mph creates a squeaking rattle that will drive you mad. Problem solved... I cut two gaskets out of the cheap floppy rubber jar openers and it seems to have stopped the vibration. 3) Under the sun-peak is a small pad to cushion up against the raised visor. When you lower the visor back down the schmutz and dust that gets stuck on the pad is now on the visor, smack in the middle of field of view.  Are any of these deal breakers? Ventilation could be for some. The other two are annoyances that come from actual riding use not addressed in studio reviews. Scorpion just needs to redesign these items... add vents, add gaskets at the visor bolts, and move pads to the side. Would I buy again? How can I not at this price point. Overall it's a freaking great helmet!\n",

View-The clear external shield offers a wide peripheral view and maintains an excellent seal in moderate rain(heavy rain not experienced yet).  No problems with fogging although I don't sweat heavily.  Rode in humid weather at moderate speeds and had no problems.   The 4 position upward tilt of the exterior shield works nicely and retains it position.  Ventilation is fine. I tend to wear the sun visor down with the shield open when I want a more  open feel. Wish the sun visor came down a hair more but it still works very well.  Its dark enough to use in most circumstances and works well at dusk.  After trying this modular, I don't think I'll use anything else.  The option of opening it up works great when riding with friends and stopping to gas up or have a quick talk.  I love this helmet... and so does everyone else (a lot of compliments)..  Make sure to check the side screws occasionally if you use the modular often.  Once in awhile  they loosen up.  Ride Safe!

No discomfort when riding and (the good news) mine were held so securely, they didn't budge when I hit some very rough patches of roadway.  I did not try the outside hood thing.

      "Pro:1) The AT950 is a reasonably priced helmet with all the features I wanted (ADV style, External sun visor, Flip up chin bar, internal sun visor...).2) This is my third Scorpion helmet (they tend to fit me well) and I fit a M in all helmets.  3) Visibility is excellent and the visor sheds water well in the rain.Con:1) The left chin strap has a double line of stitching that makes an unbending hard plate at that point.  This hits me exactly at the angle of my jaw and after doing a couple long rides the helmet has gone from comfortable to excruciating.  This makes the helmet unusable.  If they had put the stitching line somewhere else it would have been fine (it is higher on the right and I don't notice it).  The stitching can't be cut because that is what attaches the double D rings.  Customer service has no solutions at all and suggests buying a different helmet.2) The chin strap is further back and pressed against my throat (as they do with all the modular helmets).3) The face shield is quick to fog.  Despite having all vents open (which seem to do nothing) I can't get on the bike fast enough before I see moisture causing a blur at the lower edges of the visor when the temp is 50 degrees or less.  It is a good thing that the helmet can be cracked open a notch because at anything less than freeway speeds it must be opened in order to see (which is a pain off road).Bottom line is that I would not buy this helmet again.  After my call to customer service I will now have to search for another helmet.  This one was wasted money.\n",

      "I had been reading reviews on this helmet for months, and am happy to say that almost all are accurate in saying this is a 5 star helmet. I went with the extra size up from what is recommended for my head and it fits great. very comfortable, noise is cut down drastically but not sound proof. It looks great and the air flow is great.I have a KLR650, and the fact that this helmet comes with a visor that is SUPER easy to put on and take off for when I hit the highway or go off road was very attractive.The only draw back Id have to say for me was the drop down sun visor fogging up. Which is one of the features I was quite excited about. I find that with both the wind shield and sun visor down the sun visor fogs up with the first breath out of my nose. Even at high speeds with the vents down, the visor doesn't seem to de-fog. Maybe when the weather is a bit warmer, it will solve that problem. But in general I was hoping it would be great in all conditions and situations. If I use sunglasses instead with the shield down again they fog up.  I will also say that vision through the sun visor is somewhat distorted. You can get over it but it does almost feel like there is a slight prescription to it when looking through it at times.I have noticed ride out of the box the wind visor doesn't sit completely flush as its not a pin-lock. And while riding there's no air shooting into my eyes, but I do notice a slight breeze swirling in the helmet (with vents closed)  that bugs my eyes/contacts. (not a deal breaker)Again though, this helmet is great. Looks great, fits comfortable, the sun visor is easy to put down/up, has wide vision, and is decently priced for what you get. In the end if I end up rocking a pair of sunglasses with the face shield off  it still fits and looks great. Maybe ill try some sort of anti-fog coating for the sun visor and if that works then I'll be very happy with this helmet.\n",

      "I have a hard time buying helmets online because the sizing is always wrong. My head measures 23 3/4\" and in cowboy hats, I wear a size 7 3/8. That would indicate that I should wear a L or XL. I went back and forth on the sizing of this helmet because of earlier experiences.At another local shop, I tried on a different brand helmet and the XL was so tight I couldn't get it past my eyebrows to try it on. I then tried the XXL on that helmet and it was still a bit tight.As for the Scorpion, I have a Scorpion EXO-700 in XXL and it fits perfectly, though since it's ten years old, I can'treally count on that still being the case.I also have a ten-year-old Scorpion 3/4 helmet in XL that also fits perfectly. It's a quandry.So... I threw caution to the wind, ignored the helmet sizing guide and ordered this helmet in XXL.It fits perfectly and I love it; though I am really disappointed that I am unable to follow sizing guides to buy a helmet online. If you have a crazy bullom sized head like me then you should be careful ordering.I did call RevZilla to voice my concern before ordering and they put a note on my order to allow me to return it for free if it didn't fit, so you really can't go wrong ordering from RevZilla.\n",

      "I'm OBSESSED with this helmet. I haven't put too many miles on with it yet, but I'm very impressed so far. I can't believe how many amazing features are loaded into this well-made lid. This is EASILY the best bang for the buck as far as modulars go. The build quality is far above and beyond the similarly priced modular helmets (I'm thinking HJC). It's quieter. It fits better (for me at least). It feels less bulky and slightly lighter. I'm a huge fan of the enduro-style peak--it's great for general brightness/glare and especially fantastic for riding west in the afternoon. I was also happy to find that the peak doesn't grab the air or buffet much at all (unless you're riding in really strong winds, then it pulls a little...but less than I expected). I'm also a big fan of the large shield. I really only have good things to say about this helmet. If I HAD to wage a criticism--and this is very minor--I would say that I wish the shield went up one more click. You can kind of see the corners of the bottom of the shield out of the top corner of your eyes went it's raise up as far as it goes. No big deal. I got used to it after a couple rides with the shield up. That's about all I have to say, critically. I've only worn lower end helmets, so I don't know how it compares to something more like $500 and up. I would never spend that much, but it seems like that's the next price bracket up for a similar type of helmet. I can say that this is the best helmet that I've ever ridden in. Considering what you get and how well it's put together,  Scorpion's profit margin must be pretty slim on this. Impressive.\n",

      "Good helmet, but the visor is largely cosmetic\n",
      "I do like this helmet.  For the kind of riding I do (mostly hot-weather, about 60:40 on/off pavement) I won't buy anything but a modular.  After having my HJC IS MAX II survive a crash intact (with a couple scratches), I figured it was time to buy a new one so I'd have a passenger spare.  Landed with this.  Was somewhat terrified by all the cheek-pad comments, and it was true, the new pads are tight.... in my case for like the first three or four rides.  Now the helmet fits exactly as it should, snug.  Just back from a 1300 mi trip to Baja, it was great, no fatigue from wearing at, at all.  PROS: The face-shield is beautiful, all of the stop points between shut and wide open are appropriately stiff, I actually rode with it slightly open (first notch from closed) to increase ventilation (see CONS).  The modular flip up mechanism is nice, and is comparable to the HJC.  On that note, one nice thing about the sun visor, it actually protects the clear face shield from being scratched when it (or the entire hemet) is in the open position.  This is nice, as I've replaced three $20 HJC face shields in only 6 months... they scratch if you look at them wrong!  Top ventilation on the helmet works relatively well, I can feel the air being drawn across my head, even at sub-freeway speeds.  Great internal eyeshade (could be darker, yes), with a good solid flip down mechanism.  I do worry it would chop off my nose in a crash if it's down, but that goes for most of them I suspect.  CONS:I'd buy this helmet again, but here are the problems that Scorpion could fix in the next iteration:The visor is almost worthless for blocking sunlight.  It is non-adjustable, and when you look up with the helmet on, there is literally a laughably miniscule chunk of the top horizon that this thing blocks, relative to the helmet without it.  I can't understand how they let that go, as it is the oft-crowed about selling feature of this helmet. It seriously needs to be hard-adjusted down a couple of degrees, at least, to be of any sun-blocking value (to me anyhow).  The visor does catch a fair amount of air on the freeway.  After I finally pulled it off on my Baja trip (which was easily done with a peso, kudos), I was absolutely delighted at the reduction in buffetting at 60mph+.  Given it's minimal value in blocking the sun, I'm in no hurry to put it back on (except that it looks kinda bad ass).  Lower ventilation is imperceptible between open and closed, at all speeds.  Glad at least the top works well!  Again, overall I'm not intentionally steering anyone away from this helmet, I do like it a lot.  But please... it ain't no Schuberth E1, not even close, and any vendor or reviewer who claims that's the case is putting you on.\n",

I am not a ham fisted nut when handling my equipment so when I gave the strap a tug to undo the little button holding the strap up and it popped off I was not very happy. Thankfully the rest of the helmet was better than expected. I have only done two rides with it but the fit is bang on for me. It is slightly snug but I'm sure after a few rides things will fit perfectly. On my cold day ride it did an excellent job of sealing out the cold wind with the vents closed and it did nor fog up. I got the matte black and it looks awesome. It's put away tik spring now but I am very happy with the purchase except for that stupid little snap. I'm going to replace it with a metal one.

Maybe they forgot to coat that at the factory. My pinlock on my HJC crushes the anti fog that is on this helmet. The helmet looks good. The visor doesn't bother me at all at highway speeds. The fit is a little tight but I expect it will break in. I like everything about this helmet besides the anti fog technology used on it. I hope the Scorpion will just get pinlock now.

      "Wow, I will just say up front you should get this helmet if you're considering it! I am convinced there is no better dual sport helmet out there, even if money were no object (well OK it will depend on your priorities).First, I have previously owned the Arai XD-4, and this helmet is superior for my purposes. The Arai flows more air, and is lighter, but lacks the drop down sun visor or modular opening capability. It also fogs up worse than a car with a couple inside. I just rode with the Scorpion in heavy rain, and it didn't even have a spot of moisture on the lens. The drop down shade visor fogs a little worse than the visor itself, but this was only noticeable when stopped and no air was flowing.I wear earplugs so it's hard to compare, but for me it is just about as quiet as the Arai, in fact thanks to the recessed speaker pockets I think I hear my music/comms more clearly in the Scorpion. And those pockets hide your speakers behind the cheek pad fabric, so my ears are more comfortable in the Scorpion than the Arai. As others have noted, the Scorpion is a little tight in the cheeks when closed. I am a 60 cm but went up to an XL after trying both on in a store. It still fits snugly but is more comfortable. I cannot speak to long ride comfort and if it develops any pressure points.The ventilation is probably the biggest weakness of this helmet, I think they should have put more vents on the front and back of the top of the helmet. The one vent works, and you can feel the air when it's open, but I think they could have done more. The mouth vent works well and flows a lot of air to your face. But if you get into some slow technical trails you can always just flip it open and rock it trials style. I haven't tried it with goggles yet but that would be another option for hot weather or tight trail work if you want your chin protected.So with all this in mind, we come to price, and this is where Scorpion puts the other brands on notice! I would personally choose this helmet over the Arai even if the price wasn't a factor, but then you do factor it in and the Scorpion is half the price! Same goes for Shoei, and AGV is a little more affordable but still more than $100 more than the Scorpion. That's money you could be spending on new tires, luggage or whatever else you might need! The bottom line is, unless you really really need the lightest helmet or the most air flow, then this is your helmet of choice. Why pay 2x or even 4x more (Schuberth) when this helmet provides excellent features and comfort at a lower price?\n",

      "Love the features. The shield and sun visor are great for a full range of view. I currently ride without the peak visor, as 100% of my riding has been on the road at higher speeds. The padding is comfortable and seems to be holding up okay. And the modular chin bar is great for warm days sitting at a long traffic light. And the ventilation seems just fine, despite having fewer vents than other brands' offerings.The chin bar is a bit stiff at first, though the action seems to be getting a little easier with use. Originally I had to hold the helmet down to swivel the chin bar up.The helmet noise seems pretty average at normal city speeds. At about 50mph, however, it seems to get drastically louder. Around 65mph, you'll definitely want ear plugs if you plan to live there for more than a few minutes.Hopefully I'll never test the protection and crashworthiness of the helmet, though it feels substantial.Overall, it seems a fantastic product for the money.

Bill is not noticeable at highway speeds on the KTM 1190R.Sena 20S installed with not problemsLove the visor although I feel like Maverick in Top Gun when its down.Rarely ride with the main visor down even at highway speed as its too hot. Ventilation is so so and my only real complaint. Ridden in heavy rain, no leaks. I wear ear plugs always if on the freeway or long ride. Normal helmet noise IMO - nothing to write home about but not really that important to me as I have never had a quiet helmet. For Canadian buyers, placed my order on a Monday night and was at my door by Friday the same week! Awesome. Same experience with other purchases from Revzilla.\n",

      "Extremely versatile helmet!\n",
      "Being a collector of helmets (just ask my wife), I was looking for something a little different, but that could fulfill many roles. I'm starting to do some more long distance rides on my FJ09 and wanted something I didn't have to take off every time I stopped for something. I also wanted something more adventure-oriented, and as my money tree in the backyard STILL isn't producing like the guy told me it would, the Schuberth was out of the question. Enter the Scorpion. I was very excited to hear about this model and I'm glad Scorpion is filling this hole. The price is great, and the helmet is like a transformer when you consider the different ways a rider can use it. Shield up or down, peak visor on or off, with goggles or without. It's a great do-it-all helmet.That said... it's no Shoei, Arai, or Schuberth. It's comfortable enough, but not as cushy as some of the higher end models. It doesn't vent quite as well, but it IS adequate and I wasn't overheating on a 95F ride last weekend. The fit is intermediate, but you will notice the cheeks squeezing in a little as you lower the chin bar. A few hundred miles of sweat and break-in have pretty much resolved that, too.It handles my UCLEAR system just fine, so that's a bonus. I'm hoping the tinted/mirrored shields come out soon (come ON, Scorpion - August??) as the drop down shield is nice, but I don't like how hot the bottom half of my face gets when riding into the sun. The extreme visibility comes with a price for now, I suppose.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the helmet (and the amazing experience at the Boutique - if you're anywhere near Philly, I recommend you stop in and get the first class treatment I did!). It's a great value, and a versatile helmet that will be in my personal mix for years to come.\n",

      "Getting to the quick answer... It's a keeper and yes I can recommend this helmet for the price/value. Thats the short answer. If you want to know why then read-on... . I have put 300 miles riding with it that included 100 deg. down to 55 deg. temps. According to the reviews it fits too tight around the lower part of your face, I agree. Normally I fit best in a size large. I ended up ordering up a size to a XL and I am glad I did. The first ride with this helmet the cheek pads made my lower face sore like I had been chewing gum for too long. I can only imagine what it would fit like if I had gone with my normal size Large. I keep a cheap inflated ball in the helmet around the cheek pads to help break the cheek pads in. Additionally XL must be the largest shell size because I looked like Rick Moranis as \"Dark Helmet\". This helmet is long front to back and has that beak on top so in a cross wind this helmet gets pushed on hard. Compared to my other helmets,Shoei,HJC and Nolan the interior material is not as comfortable, plush or quiet. The venting is ok but could use more to draw in air. I consider this a heavy helmet because I can feel the \"mass\" when rotating my head side to side. If you are concerned about looks my daughter says it is Transformer vs Predator vs Alien (squint your eyes a bit and you will see it). For the money this is a great bang for the buck. This is my first helmet with the drop down shade visor (I found it very useful )or ADV style. It's not priced as a Shoei, Schubert, or Arai and not built the same. It is a great helmet in function, style and price range. Just remember you are not paying for a $800 helmet.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet yesterday, halfway through a 700 mile round trip ride. I tossed my old one, donned the new one, and immediately hit the road on a 350 mile ride home. In short, I'm very pleased with the Scorpion EXO-AT950.The inside padding on this Scorpion is very snug, but not uncomfortable. The key selling point for me was the interior-mounted visor that didn't interfere with my glasses, and the modular design, to which I've grown accustomed. Upon purchasing, I immediately removed the peak visor and installed the side port covers, which were easy to replace, only taking a couple of minutes. Riding a V-Star 1300T with the tall windshield, the noise level was average. With earplugs, the noise dropped considerably, as one would expect. My trip lasted all day, with speeds up to 80 mph, a temperature range between 50-90 deg F, and altitudes between 6000-8000 ft. The weather was clear, so I cannot comment on performance in wet conditions. The ventilation was sufficient, and comfortable the entire time. The shapes of the chin bar and internal sun visor (midline nose cut outs) took some getting used to, but the visor and chin bar module are very easy to operate with one hand. The face shield is a little stiff to operate one handed. The chin strap is comfortable, thanks to the long pads extending below the neck padding. Lastly, I was surprised by the high quality available at this affordable price. I am happy with this purchase, and would highly recommend it.\n",

      "I've bought this model around 2weeks ago,had wonderful 10~20mins city rides or simple joyridesView / Vision / Stylethis model will fit you, IF you are riding naked bikesI'm riding a MV Agusta Brutale Dragster 800and it fits perfectly. as this helmet has huge wind shieldthe vision is great the only thing that they could have done better is the wind shield lockage, there are 3 level of lockage on this shield, it has a rather very wide range so even if you close your wind shield to a minimum level, the open gap is pretty huge and most likely anything will be sucked in.Noisebecause of the cheap or cost saving result of chin guards it flows tons of air thus the noise level is as described from Revzilla's review, its \"RELATIVELY\" quite, ive done 30~80mph its okay for short rides but for a longer route, you might want to get a pair of ear plugs.External Peak / Internal Sun Visorthey are all good Peaks are needed when you are riding in a sunny day, internal sun visor is dark enough even during the day or night. if you have a good eye sight, you could probably use this internal visor during night rides in the city to avoid any high beams or flashy HID headlights.Size / FitmentI used to have a Shoei GT_Air Large which fits me perfectly i mean literally perfect. and i was Advised from Revzilla that if i were to wear a Large Size GT_Air, i would probably not have any fitment issue on this helmet if i ordered a Large size as well. but guess what the helmet is rather a bit narrow on the jaws/cheeks so it crushes my face/cheeks and once rode with this helmet for about an hour, it started to hurt my jaws like i chewed a gum for a whole hour. i think its because of its modular design, somehow when you close your helmet, the helmet tightens the jaw/cheek part very much, which was tighter than i ever expected.so if you like this helmet you might want to watch the sizing or fitment and maybe wear another Scorpion helmets to get the perfect sizing.\n",

The modular design is handy when your nose gets itchy, but for the money I think I could have done better. I'll see if I can compress the cheek pads in a vice to make them more comfortable, otherwise I think I made a mistake with this purchase, it's too bad because the helmet looks great, is versatile, and has a excellent field of vision.\n",

Obviously very well thought out features. If I had to pick a negative, it would be the drop down sun visor. It doesn't extend down far enough, so you get a visible 'line' in your line of sight. Small nitpicky thing. The sun visor blocks enough sun that I only need the drop down shield when I'm facing into direct sunlight. If it's a good fit for your head, you will love this helmet.\n",

I was in local Honda Shop, tried on a Shoei, and immediately knew that was the answer to my problems. I was going to buy a GT Air II, but found a deal in the original GT Air here on Revzilla and pulled the trigger. I could not be happier! The most comfortable helmet I have ever had. Quality is top notch, inside and out. The internal drop down sun visor got hazy after a long hot sweaty day of riding, so I need to clean it, but that is only a minor inconvenience.

      "The best helmet I've ever owned, and I've owned MANY\n",
      "Let me first state that I've owned or useda about 28(!) helmets in the last five years in the search for the \"perfect\" helmet, focusing mainly on how quiet it is and of course overall quality/safety. Just a small sample of what I've owned and tested: a Schuberth C3 Pro, a Schuberth R2, 3 Arai RX-Q's and a Corsair X, a Shoei RF1100, RF1200, Multitec, Neotec, 2 X-14's and 2 GT-Airs, 5 Bell helmets, Nolan, a Vozz RS 1.0 helmet, the Sena Momentum INC and on and on. And I don’t believe in brand loyalty, so no bias in this review in that way.I'll start by saying in clean air, this may be the quietest helmet made. This is the only helmet I've ever owned that I'm willing to ride without ear plugs at surface street speeds. For sure, once I got rid of the sport touring windscreens on my two sportbikes and let the air hit me lower, putting this helmet in clean air, just WOW. Just a pleasant quiet whoosh even over 80 mph. It does get a little louder with both vents open but no worse than any other helmet. This helmet has a fairly stout and 3d shaped/molded neck roll that I imagine contributes to the silence, but at first you won't believe how hard it is to get the helmet on. Now, get this: I'm on my 2nd GT-Air and this one also WHISTLES like no other, coming from the latch area.  I mean, standing on the pegs in perfectly clean air, it whistles loudly by the latch. My first one did this and I did everything to try to fix it and even sent it to Shoei. They claimed they didn't hear anything and sent it back, though they did try to reposition the shield. At first, I was not happy of course. You can tell the whistle comes from near the latch because with the visor closed (and notched) you can easily slide a piece of paper around in that area and of course when you cover that area with your hand it stops. But I decided to put some felt by the latch covered in black tape and this fixed it. This helmet is otherwise so awesome and quiet that I still stick with it despite having black tape on the left side. I was then in a bad accident in that helmet about a year ago, run off the highway at 70 mph. I broke a lot of bones but the helmet protected me perfectly. Also, the medics did indeed use the emergency cheek pad system to get the helmet off of me gently. So, after the accident, I then try a few more helmets and ultimately nothing is as good as this helmet and I buy another GT-Air, knowing full well it might whistle too - and it did. I put some felt and black tape down the left side and deal with it. It’s also obvious that it doesn’t whistle for most people – looks at all the five star reviews. I guess I'm just unlucky.Fit: pure IO. This helmet fits my head like a glove in size small. The interior padding is top notch. It's probably not quite as soft as some but no matter. I couldn’t be happier with the padding inside. I'd prefer not to have a internal visor (since Phoenix is so hot I need a tinted visor anyway, bought from Japan) but it's nice as a 2nd sunblocker for when the sun is high. I run the Sena 10U in the helmet too. Solid and reliable, like an old friend. Also the placement and action of this the internal visor is perfect. I prefer its location compared to the bottom like on a Schuberth.Love the action of the chin vent. Super easy to open and close to know what position it’s in. Also appreciate the middle notch on the top vent. I do use it.  At speed, this helmet is quite stable. No issues there. I know it sounds crazy to say the helmet whistles out of the box and still love it, but I do. Over the years I've tried so many helmets but this one is just like home to me. I'm curious if the GT-Air II is just as good and doesn't need modification to not whistle, but when you add the comms in we're talking a $900 plus move and when this helmet is so good... no need right now. This helmet is so good I'm literally shopping for a 2nd - maybe one to better match my other bike and as a backup to get me through the next many years in case my... future, inbound helmet doesn't work out. Shoei - you already know this and it's probably why you think your poo doesn't stink but this is a masterpiece and beats all comers, even despite the flawed visor sealing mechanism!\n",

Air flow is good. Only downside to it is the fog guard that is removable at the bottom side of the face shield doesn’t seem to stay in place.\n",

      "Good Helmet But Tight as F Check Pads!\n",
      "I got this helmet because I wanted a backup/spare full face to my go to Aria Defiant X full face. I never bought/owned a Shoei before. I now have 3 HJCs, 3 Arias and now the Shoei GT-Air.  I have a 57.75 cm head circumference with an intermediate oval shape, so a medium is the correct size helmet for me using the standard charts. However, I found that a large helmet with thicker padding works best for me. Even in the large size the Shoei GT Air the check pads crush in way too hard on my check bones. If you have high check bones like me you will need to get the thinner check pads. Other than that I do like the helmet. The air flow is excellent. The vent controls are logical and easy to reach/feel even with gloves on. I have the Pinlock visor installed. There is a bit of distortion with it installed that I don't get in my similarly equipped Aria Defiant X and HJC RPHA 90. The sun shade system work great and is distortion free. I use a Cardo Packtalk JBL  com system. It works great in the Shoei GT-Air. Sound is like a good pair of headphones. Which brings me to my biggest gripe about the Shoei. The reason I got the GT-Air instead of the GT-Air 2 is because Shoei reconfigured the new helmet to use a dedicated Sena com system. That was a very unfortunate decision by Shoei as it locks one into an inferior com system IMO. I have a Sena 20 Evo as well, which is junk compared to the Cardo Packtalk. If Shoei continues down the Sena path and Sena doesn't vastly improve, this will be my last Shoei helmet.\n",

      "This was my first helmet, and it's going strong almost 2 years later.It's hard to beat the convenience of an internal sun visor.  The GT Air scores 3 out of 5 stars on the UK SHARP rating scheme, which means that it exceeds DOT minimum standards by a large margin.  You'll probably want something Snell-rated for the track, but for everyday riding and touring you can't do much better than the GT Air.The only part I've had a problem with is the Pinlock insert.  It is too easily scratched, expensive to replace, and you cannot buy extra pins anywhere.  Worst, it fogs up quickly in city riding.  I replaced my Pinlock with a Fog City Pro.\n",

      "I live in Texas and in spite of the brutal summer weather conditions I try to get out and ride as much as I can year round. This helmets' features seemed appealing: good ventilation and build in visor. However, they are almost mutually exclusive. Once you put down the visor, it blocks all the airflow to your brow. This is really awful in summer. In cooler locations this would be a good buy. In the south it is a torture chamber on your head.\n",

      "Quiet at the expense of ventilation\n",
      "On a road trip 2 days out and I drop my AGV - the shield pops out and I find the little pin that holds it is broken. Not wanting to risk losing both sides I find a Cycle Gear along my way and end up with the GT Air - not my first choice but in a pinch and on the recommendation of the Gear staff I went for it. Here's the good -- excellent quality - made in Japan (AGV GT Veloce was Chinese made btw). Matte black with white looks good, internal sunscreen is great idea and I love it, pinlock included, eyeglasses accomodated. 2 days and 700 miles later I can tell you I like it and it is amazingly quiet. This is a top selling helmet and I can understand why. However here's what I don't like --  the ventilation is nearly imperceptible. Opening and closing vents at speed changes little - especially the chin vent. You can notice a small 'cool spot' on the top of your head if you open the top vents (the rear vent push forward to open - counter intuitive) but that's about all. I am guessing the emphasis on quiet means the helmet takes in less air to accomplish the low dBs. I keep looking at the helmet thinking there is something blocking the air vents like left over packing material or a flap of extra fiberglass but I don't see any impediments. Thi is a hot helmet that fogs easily and seriously bad - I have had to open the visor to get some airflow and clear it despite the pinlock. Never experienced this with the AGV or Arai and it was disconcerting today when merging onto the highway in a rain storm. Second gripe - this is one heavy sucker or at least compared to my AGV and previous Arai. I am thinking this is a 5 year old design and maybe materials have progressed but you sure feel the weight of it. And to nit pick - the chin strap snap is halfway buried under the neck roll - PITA to snap it off. If you don't expect much heat or humidity where you ride it is a great helmet. I am enjoying riding through the rockies in the cool spring air but I dread returning to Arizona. I will keep this helmet for northern trips and cool weather. I don't know why this is called the 'air'? I was expecting great airflow or maybe lightness as in light as air but I don't experience either. Is quiet the tradeoff for ventilation?\n",

      "Like it with some caveats\n",
      "I love the idea that you don't have to carry a clear and a dark shield.  The inner dark shield operates easily and smoothly.That said... the pinlock keeps the main visor from fogging, but the inner one will still fog like crazy.When you have the inner one down you are looking through six surfaces (2 on the main shield, 2 on the pinlock, 2 on the inner shield), and all those surfaces degrade the image you see.  It's not terrible, but it's noticeable.The ear pockets fold the tops of my ears down when I put the helmet on, and I have to rock it back and forth sideways until my ears drop into those pockets.This helmet works great on my adv bikes and on my KTM SuperDuke 1290 R because of the upright position.  However on my Aprilia Tuono 1100 Factory, the position is closer to a sportbike tuck and I find the top of the eyeport is really close to where I need to look.  I find that distracting, and bought an RF-1200 with the Transition shield to get around both of those issues.\n",

      "After having owned a shoei  RF – SR for a couple of years, when it was time to buy a new helmet, I gravitated back toward that brand because of my good experience with it. The shoei  GT Air   Is a good solid helmet for a reasonable price. I own an Arai  helmet and a Schuberth and, honestly, the build quality and feature set  seems every bit as good on the GT Air.  Like most other helmets of this brand, I was able to install a SENA Bluetooth communications unit easily. It even has cut outs for the speakers in the area of the ears. The GT air has a drop-down dark visor  which is pretty easy to use with gloves on as well as the vent switches. They are all glove accessible. The GT air is only marginally more airy then the other helmets in this brand. It is reasonably quiet and average and wait. The  visibility of the side of the visor is good enough to make head checks hey simple affair. In all of the brands wine, I find that the visor is a little clunky to put up and down and difficult to use with one hand. It always seems slightly off-balance and feels like it is bending too much.   It is also kind of a pain in the butt to remove from the helmet. That said, all in all I would recommend this helmet without reservation because it is as good as any helmet and better than most.\n",

      "Buy this helmet.  Buy 2, in case you lose one.\n",
      "I have a big head and some brands really put the pinch on me.  Shoei in 2XL is  perfect fit for me.  A helmet has to fit right, so lets's just assume you can find a perfect fit in the GT Air.Let's talk about features.  The airflow part of the GT Air is generous and works very well.  Just the chin vent has been enough for now, but I tried both roof vents at speed, and they work great.  The rear vent flows so well your hair gets blown around, which might be annoying if you don't need it, but on a sweaty day I suspect it's heaven.  The flip down sun visor should just be mandatory.  That is one feature I have never had and will now never go without.  It's easy to operate, and the visor bottom is just at the lower range of view, so with a minimal raise of the chin you can see your instruments clearly and still be getting relief from the sun.  It's terrific.The face shield is pretty stiff when new, and the first few times I removed it for cleaning I had to sit and study the release mechanism.  After a few cycles it loosened up enough to work well without being loose in any way.This helmet came with the pin shield, and I have never ridden without it, so I can only report that there is no fog, ever.  I use the removable chin dam, so that should increase the fog problems, but I have had zero.The chin dam and cheek pads are easily removed, and chin pads are offered in three thicknesses to fine tune your fit.It's a 10.  I got mine in cueball white, mostly because it's still statistically the safest color for helmets.Once you get over the cost, you will have no more regrets.\n",

      "I live in Eastern North Carolina where winter riding can be sub 20s or 80 degrees. This has allowed me to try my new GT-AIR in a wide range of temperatures. This morning on my ride to work it was 34. I had the pinlock installed and all the vents closed. There was only a small amount of fog around the perimeter of the visor where the pinlock didn’t cover. When head east on the highway the sun is in my face. The flip down sunshield is a huge asset here. Last week my rides were warmer, mid to high 70s. Open up all the vents and the “air Mohawk” they discribe in the video becomes reality. It’s flows and amazing amount of air. The top forward vent is like ram air induction for your scalp! Only two minor complaints with this helmet, the switch to lower the sun visor is a little stiff and the snap to take up the excess chin strap is hard to find. I’m sure I will get used to both in time. As a side note, I ride a BMW R1100rs so I’m in a semi tucked position and the visibility is great. I highly recommend this helmet especially at this price point.\n",

During the winter (no less than 35 degrees), it slightly fogs up and my  head doesn't get very cold although I have to have the front mouth vent open. I also wear glasses, meaning that the interior visor is amazing for me and my glasses don't pinch my head. Riding with just the internal visor is perfectly fine. In the end, I absolutely love it\n",

      "Best Helmet I've Owned\n",
      "I've been riding motorcycles for 37 years and have owned many helmets.  This is the best I've owned.  The Pros:  (1) comfortable for intermediate oval-shaped heads, (2) comes in White for visibility, (3) accepts Sena Bluetooth device, (4) looks cool, (5) full-face security and safety, (6) visor opens with several positions for airflow at slow speeds, (7) anti-fog visor insert.The Cons: (1) Needs more airflow.  I set the chin bar and top vents open and snap the visor into place, but can't really feel air flow in the summer heat.  I know the air flows because I can feel it over the top [like a Mohawk] when my head is wet.  So this feature cools the inside of the helmet with passive air flow, not an active jet stream, (2) when turning my head to check for traffic there is a whistling noise which goes away when looking straight ahead; (3) the vents collect bug guts and the crevices are difficult to clean--a trade-off for the air flow.Overall: I would buy this helmet again.  The pros outweigh the cons.  And very few products can be perfect considering personal preferences.\n",

      "I put over 60,000 miles on my first Shoei GT Air, daily rider rain or shine, temps from 51 to 103, from daily commute to work to long road trips out of state. Helmet fit my semi intermediate/semi long oval headshape fine, comfort level never was a problem for me even on rides from LA to Vegas and back.air flow was adequate, I had a bluetooth coms unit hooked up with internal speakers and a mic, and they all fit perfectly inside the helmet no hassle.I wear glasses and I am able to wear them comfortably once helmet is on thanks to the cut outs in the cheeckpads.Easy one finger operation of dropdown sunshield and cracking faceshield.This helmet is pricey but it is also packed with plenty of features that you will be glad are there if you are riding heavy use.Got suddenly cut off and clipped by a distracted/lost driver, slammed into vehicle, pinned between bike and van and then ejected and skidded on pavement!6 broken ribs and internal injuries but my head has absolutely zero damage or trauma, Helmet took it hard!!I wouldnt be writting this right now if it werent for that helmet!!The negatives.....it does seem to fog up easy on me.Note: I chose NOT to use the pinlock antifog shield as it is not safe for night riding, and I ride all hours and didnt want to hassle with multiple face shields.....crack visor for city driving wipe some shaving cream on the inside of face shield and buff, and there ya go...no fog.wind noise is there especially with faster highway riding, but it never was bad enough to interfere with my coms unit or ruin any gopro videos etc.Can you find a better helmet with more features??eh...maybe but youll pay another $200 or more for it.Oh, guess what just showed up at the door 48 hours after placing my order on Revzilla?Thats right, my 2nd Shoei GT Air!!New bike, new helmet, old ribs.....lets ride!!Thanks Team Revzilla and Shoei!!!!\n",

      "After riding with this for two years, I'm disappointed. This helmet was good on an adventure bike, but I absolutely hate it on my new bike; an Aprilia Tuono.Somehow on the naked bike the helmet manages to be loud and turbulent, yet has no ventilation. It similarly lacked decent ventilation on any faired bike I rode (the air means mediocre venting, nothing more). My Bell MX-9 Adventure is louder on the Tuono, but far less turbulent, even with the peak.The custom fit Sena is amazing, and the drop down visor works perfectly. The pinlock is excellent, although vision is cut way too short when close to a tuck.My recommendation is pay close attention to what kind of bike you'll use this on, and stay away for naked bikes.All things considered, I'm already looking at cheaper helmets for next season. I refuse to spend $500+ on a helmet that I'd barely better than the $300 helmets out there by companies like bell now.\n",

      "GT-Air: A commuter's 4 year review\n",
      "Background: I commute year round in northern Virginia and, after 4 years and 70,000 miles of use, just replaced my GT-Air with an Arai Signet-X.Summary: On paper, the GT-Air is a commuter's dream. The integrated sun-visor and \"Helmet of the Year\" WebBikeWorld award were the biggest selling points for me. In practice, the helmet has some significant shortcomings specific to cold weather and wet weather riding.Pros: I loved the integrated sun shade and overall comfort of the helmet. My commute has me leave before sun-rise and return home riding westward into the sun. Not having to carry a separate smoke visor is great feature. The integrated sun visor is second nature to activate, is plenty dark, and works flawlessly. The helmet is all day-comfortable and fairly quiet.Cons: From my first chilly morning ride, I immediately noticed the helmet would quickly fog and be difficult to clear. Opening the visor to the first detent would direct the cold air directly up into my eyes. Resting the visor on the lock (fog setting) simply would not clear the fog if riding below highway speeds. The chin vent simply was insufficient to clear the fog below highway speeds. The only option I found was to use the included pinlock insert. When new, it works pretty well. Although the instructions prohibit night use, i used it anyway and became use to the slight \"halo effect\" the pinlock generates at night. Problem is, the pinlock is extremely vulnerable to scratching and, over time, requires repeated re-adjustment of the eccentric mounting posts to maintain a full seal of the gasket with the visor. I can easily see replacing the pinlock two or three times a year to maintain optimal visual clarity.The rain performance of the helmet was simply inexcusable. From day one, rain drops would end up on the inside of the visor within 10 minutes. As best I could determine, water would eventually make its way from the chin vent and be directed up onto the visor interior. Also, cracking the visor to clear fog would result in water quickly being directed onto the visor interior. In both cases, vision during rain was a major issue for me.Overall: If you almost always ride in warm and sunny condition, the shortcomings I've noted with this helmet are not relevant. The integrated sun-visor alone makes the helmet a great sunny weather helmet. However, if you will be riding in the cold or rain, i would recommend considering other options. While all helmets fog and are susceptible to water intrusion, the GT-Air's performance on these fronts was significantly below average.\n",

      "First premium helmet\n",
      "Let me start by saying, I researched for months before landing on the GT-air finally (back and forth between the defiant, GT-Air, and RF1200). The features are amazing, the helmet is well built, and there is a good attention to detail in finish work, with one HUGE flaw (more on this later). I received my helmet, and wore it around, enjoyed the fit, finally decided I made the right choice, and a few days later took off on my first ride with it. A nice long 120 mile round trip with a mixture of interstate, and state highways after sunset to really test out the versatility as temperatures dropped but starting out at 75* ambient and finishing off the night at a much more brisk 55*. Comfort and view out are absolutely top notch. All of my prior helmets were $200ish HJCs, so I expected this to be much better hands down. It was better, but I'm not sure it was 3x price better. The overall impression of quality and finish does bring it up to that level, however.About that pesky problem I mentioned, as I said there is an impression of quality with this helmet, that somewhere along the way failed. Best I can tell the visor shield acts like it's not even made for this helmet (too large) which seems logical given that there are 5 shell sizes and one shield size. I've re-adjusted several times, had a local dealer adjust it, and no matter what I get a constant whistle at anything over 70MPH. I will say I did finally find one place the whistle moved to 80+ (which is a non-problem for me, strictly did this for testing), however then I was unable to close the shield without also pressing on the right upper quadrant. At that point it's adjusted back as tight as it will go on either side, and as said, won't really close easily at all. I've contacted shoei about this and waiting to hear back, but being stuck with a ~$600 helmet that screams at speed sure is annoying. - here's hoping they stand behind their product! As we all know the rules once ridden in :/ which stinks because there is NO way I could've known about this without riding. Onto General noise disregarding the above. This helmet is incredibly quiet when in the \"proper\" position. I say this because I find I have to tilt my chin down slightly to where I'm uncomfortably looking upwards slightly and then it drops to near silent riding under 60MPH! Absolutely incredible! However, I don't naturally decline my head like this, so instead about 70% of my ride I listen to a constant roar that turns into a boom (pressure) with earplugs in. Optically I'm in love with this helmet (and as an Optician, that says something!). The optics are precise and clear even with the sun-visor down. That's no easy feat, and requires a matching of curves of the internal and external visors to result in a true plano surface... add to that it's distortion and aberration free and I'm an overjoyed camper.ventilation is also great! The \"mohawk of air\" is very noticable, and the helmet surprised me once all vents were closed off by not allowing any of the cool outside air in! This was a totally new experience to me, and a great one at that. I did find occasionally I had to crack the mouth vent to clear the shield as I didn't have the pinlock in. Remember, optician.. The glare and distortion that piece of plastic crap creates is more irritating than the fogging it prevents to me.In short, I love the helmet minus a few major caveats that are currently ruining my enjoyment. If Shoei won't sort it out I'll suck up my losses and move onto an AGV Veloce S to try next..... (I'm equally amazed with my dainese riding gear, so I'm excited to try their helmet if all else fails). If it didn't whistle at speed, and roar without tilting my chin down, this helmet is PERFECT, and I would be head over heals in love. But it does whistle, and it does roar, and I would honestly rather have my FG-17 back that was loud overall but didn't whistle or roar, even at giving up some comfort and a complete lack of airflow.\n",

      "I have ridden bikes for almost 4 decades now and currently rotate amongst 8 helmets in my collection that includes Shoei Neotec, Scorpion Exo 950, Shoei 1200, a couple HTC's, and a couple esoteric ones.  I have a Schuberth C4 on order and hope to make that my main helmet for commutes.But as of now, I find it really hard to not grab the GT Air every time I head out the door.  The fit is true, comfortable, and is high quality.  The noise level is really low while still having good to great ventilation and the visibility is wide and clear.  I love that the pinlock comes in the box.Is it the best helmet I've ever had?  Maybe.  I use to ride with an Arai that I dearly loved but I can't tell how much of that is fond memory over side by side comparison.If you are ok with having a built in drop down sun shade then I believe this is the best helmet for all around use off the track.\n",

      "I bought this helmet after buying a Bell Qualifier dlx which was very light and comfortable, but LOUD AF! The Shoei is noticeably heavier, very slightly less comfortable, and much quieter. Air flow was about the same. For more than twice the price it is still worth it to me because I can wear ear plugs and use my com system on the highway without going deaf from wind noise.\n",

      "Worth considering\n",
      "Of my several helmets, for day trips I choose the GT AIR and for over the road the NeoTec.   The major difference is simply the modular style of the NeoTec.   When compared to my RF1200 the GT AIR has better ventilation whereas the RF1200 is quieter.   With ear plugs there is no difference to me.   The versatility of the inner visor is a major plus.  When traveling through variable light conditions it is easy to lower or raise the inner shield.   All three of the aforementioned helmets seal tightly and eliminate rain drizzle or drops from entering the interior.   But, be sure to close the GT AIR top vent when encountering rain.  My Arai RXQ and Quantum 2 are up for sale.\n",

      "There is a reason why this helmet costs so much. It is night and day from all other lower end brants (Bilt, Builtwel, Bell, Simpson). Airflow is amazing. Look is amazing. I get compliments almost daily on the helmet. Feels like a hug for my head. Fits like a helmet should. Vision is on par with other reviews. In a full tuck your top vision is reduced but the drop down visor is worth it. Love not having to swap out visors. Air flow is on point. Plenty of air through the front and I can feel it coming out the back. Never fogs. Thank you pinlock. You're amazing.\n",

      "I have 800 miles on helmet so far.  The built in sun visor was key selling point since I wear glasses and prescription sun glasses do not work for me.  The sun visor works well and does not interfere with glasses.  Immediate access from clear to dark worked will in the South Texas partly cloudy ride.  Heritage Harley is still noisy, although I did not wear ear plugs. Honda F6 only wind noise and not much of that with the chin guard.  Shoei should allow to select cheek pad size when ordering.  Although I squished the pads overnight and reduced the break-in cycle.  Went from squished checks to acceptable.  Over several days didn't notice any discomfort but would say cheek pads are still tight.Airflow is ok, but behind large windshield is not overly forced.I have bought motorcycles for what this helmet cost so the price felt high.  However, it is good quality and well thought out.  Has reduced buffeting, quiet padding, solid detent positions on the face shield, and a real sun visor, Makes the ride more enjoyable.\n",

      "Overly hyped? Yes.\n",
      "Overall a well made helmet but let's start with the gripes. I purchased the GT Air with the Wonderer graphic. Now unavailable and at the time it was a discounted item. Even with the discount this is a very expensive helmet. I previously owned a HJC RPHA ST and wanted to upgrade. With the word \"air\" in the helmet's name and having read numerous reviews I had my expectations set pretty high. To be honest I'm not sure why folks give this such high marks on air flow. The two vents on the top of the helmet make no difference in air flow or noise in the respective open or closed positions. My previously mentioned HJC RPHA ST actually had much better air flow.  Next gripe is the fogging visor. Every other review I read about this complaint was spot on accurate. You absolutely must use the (thankfully) provided Pinlock lense. I don't think there is a more fog prone visor out there. It's baffling how bad it it given the helmet's premium status. I'll chalk this up to poor air flow design from the chin vent. Even with the visor cracked to the first detent, it would intensely fog in 70° temperatures while riding in stop and go traffic. Next item of contention is the provided breath guard. It does not come fitted onto the helmet but installation is not the issue. The breath guard staying in place is the issue. Several times while putting my helmet on or taking it off, the breath guard simply falls off. This would be expected and forgiven on a helmet in a much lower bracket but in this range it's inexcusable. Now onto the good.I intitially tried the GT Air on at a local brick and mortar shop. The moment I put the helmet on I thought, \"so this is what I've been missing!\". Here the premium status is readily obvious. The fit and feel is worth every penny. The other big plus of this helmet is the stability at speed. The aerodynamic research involved in this helmet again is worth every penny spent. There is no buffeting at speed even on my naked bike with a short screen attached. Swinging my head at speed for traffic is without consequence as well. In summary, I feel the helmet is top notch in the ways a helmet should be. If the air flow is improved on the next rendition of this model, I may buy another. Until then I'll be looking at the competition in this price range and feature set.\n",

After many years running with different lids, went to Shoei, and won't buy anything else.  I got a large, fits the same as the older RF's, so no surprises there.  I internal visor is a nice feature but took a little getting used to because it doesn't go down all the way inside the helmet so it is kind of in your line of sight.\n",

      "I went to this helmet after riding with a Bell MX-9 Adventure for almost two years. Obviously they are very different helmets designed for different purposes, but I've found that the Shoei GT-Air is a superior helmet for the majority of my riding. Compared to the Bell, the Shoei is very quiet, very comfortable, much more aerodynamic, has sufficient air flow, and the drop down sun visor is a great feature...no more taking sunglasses on/off to remove the helmet. The only reason I didn't give this helmet five stars is because the face shield seems to fog easily. I live in Southern California and I've never noticed my Bell MX-9 fogging up (likely more air flow, and much louder as well). I haven't bothered with the pinlock, but may try that or an anti-fogging treatment. All in all however, I am extremely pleased with this helmet. I definitely recommend!\n",

      "3000 Mile Review\n",
      "I researched helmets for approximately 6 months before purchasing and have now used it for about 3000 miles on two motorcycles with 3 different windscreens, two adjustable for height, in both warm and cold weather, sun and rain, in the city and at highway speed, and both with and without earplugs. My only real point of comparison was a Shoei TZR that should have been replaced sooner. The bikes I have used it on are a 2012 R1200GS and 2016 K1600GTL. During that time I have experienced essentially every positive and negative that I have read in other reviews and can probably provide some insight.First the build quality is excellent. I looked at Schuberth and Arai helmets and think the build quality of Shoei helmets are equivalent at a lower price. I would have purchased one of the others if that was not the case. Fit is snug, but it fits my head and size is equivalent to my TZR. It is snug in the cheek area, but it really should be. You don't want the helmet to move in an accident. Look at the face of an F1 driver in helmet sometime. Their cheeks are pushed up by the pressure of the cheek pads. I have ridden empty tank to empty tank in comfort. The only fit negative I have experienced was mentioned by others. The chin strap can irritate your Adam's apple, but that is going to be neck dependent. Also, the padding under the strap is shorter than on the TZR and should be longer to better protect the neck.Air flow is good and I love the pinlock visor. I have had zero fogging in conditions that would have been difficult in my TZR without pinlock. Visibility is very good for a full face helmet. I wanted a helmet with a flip down sun visor. It is well made and easy to operate. I do wish it was a little darker, but it handles most sun situations. If you are riding directly into a sunrise or sunset you might need sunglasses depending on how sensitive your eyes are. Now to noise. I wanted a quiet helmet and one thing that concerned me as I read both professional and customer reviews is that some said it is very quiet and some said it is very loud. I will say it depends. I normally ride with earplugs, but have used it on short trips without. As you might expect the noise level is very (almost totally) dependent on how the air hits the helmet. At full highway speed with earplugs in, if I duck below the windscreen on my k1600, it is eerily quiet. On a windscreen that dumps turbulent air right into the top vent it will be loud. If you can adjust your screen so that it does not it will be quiet. It is also louder if the vent is on the more open setting. Maybe more important and I think an explanation for the difference in opinion on loudness is that the venting and aerodynamics seem to be more for a sport bike position than an upright touring or adventure bike position (my two main bikes). If you simply rotate your head forward and down a few degrees like you would be on a sport bike it gets much more quiet. At below 55 mph it is quiet. No unusual pressure when you turn your head to check for traffic.Would I buy it if I had to do over again? I am happy with the helmet. It really helped when I changed the windscreen on my GTL. For a sport bike I would have no hesitation. For a touring bike I might go with the Neotec, but I really didn't want a modular. Just not my thing. Ultimately, I would probably stick with this helmet as a good all around helmet.\n",

      "I retired my old Shoei RF1100 and I hoped to find another Shoei that was more quiet with better ventilation. The GT Air  has exceeded my expectations and the flip down sun visor is a bonus. My old Shoei was a size large and I ordered the GT Air in the same size, but it fits slightly tighter, As always, use the sizing guide and your preferences for fit. Shoei has moved a step forward with this one.\n",

      "Inner Visor is Awful\n",
      "I've owned many Shoei helmets in my 34 years of riding, and have loved them all -- except  this one. I even got a substancial discount on mine because I worked at a dealership when I purchased it. My complaint? The inner visor is useless. It, like all other makers' models with them that I've seen, does not come down far enough. When lowered, there is a sizeable gap between the bottom of the visor and the top of the chin piece, so at any speed air travels through gap and irritates your eyes enough to make using it unsafe. If they made it lower another 3/4\" that would probably make all the difference in the world, but then it wouldn't have  the cool fighter pilot helmet look they're obviously going for. It's fine up to about 30 mph, but after that the irritation becomes blinding. I wholly regret the purchase and wish that I had just gone for the proven RF model.\n",

It does not flow air as well, nor is it quite as comfortable as my old (which I still use on occasion) arai. however, it is quiet on my street triple r, and noisier on my cb500r-a due to the fairing causing turbulence. I took the chin guard out for the summer and heard more noise. winter is coming I will replace it and the helmet will be quieter. I ordered the thinner cheek pads to increase comfort, hopefully to Arai levels. I BELIEVE as someone else said, that Shoei should give you the option of cheek pad size so you don't have to spend even more money! this is a no brainer I would think. the tinted drop down visor is OUTSTANDING and worth the $$. may increase the comfort rating once I ride with the thinner pads.\n",

      "Very happy with this purchase. I've been wearing Shoei for over 15 years and always impressed with the quality. My last helmet is several years too old and replacing it should have happened sooner, which I'm reminded of every time I put this new one on. The internal sun visor is a neat idea, but I'd still like a full dark smoke face shield, as the internal sun visor blocks some light, but I still see bright light inside the helmet and it's a bit distracting. Through a web search I've found that tinted face shields ARE available for this helmet, but primarily from outside the US. I'll be upgrading the face shield to dark smoke sooner rather than later, as I could see the clear face shield and internal sun visor not cutting it on a long (multi-state) trip....at least for me. For around town use, the clear and sun visor works well. Not a \"super quiet\" helmet, but by no means \"loud,\" either. If you're like me and have been putting off replacing your worn out helmet stop putting it off and replace it already!!!\n",

      "Pros: - Internal Sun visor is well-made and incredibly useful-Shoei build quality. All the moving parts feel a lot more sturdy and smooth compared to my previous helmets-Very quiet. With vents closed, it's by far the quietest helmet I've tried.- Fits snugly and easily, very comfortable.Cons: - The main visor fogs up very easily, even with all vents open on a warm, non-humid day. There's a pinlock lens included which fixes this, but pinlock lenses cause weird reflections at night.-Air flow is on the poor side, which can make it a little hot. This is probably why it's so quiet.-The main visor is a little awkward. You have to push pretty hard to lock it all the way, and it's difficult to quickly crack it at stop lights.\n",

      "I do not have large experience with many helmets. So that is just my unprofessional opinion. For something called GT-Air ventilation is a OK. Vents are very easy to operate and I can feel the air passing over top of my head. Windshield has no way to crack open. First notch is too big and air gets to your eyes very fast. Internal sun visor is awesome idea but in this case leaves corners exposed, probably to not cover the mirrors but that gives sun light ability to get to your eyes and it gets annoying. On my heads has two pinch points. After couple of hours I am getting headache. In the rain water gets under the collar, not often but it does. Protection is kind of average, nothing special has been mentioned anywhere. Everybody has the same stuff this days. I will expect something more innovative from Shoei.

      "In the video review it is recommended that if you are between sizes you should purchase the smaller size because the helmet will break-in about 10%. This may be true of the smaller sizes, which use thicker cheek and top padding, but it doesn't seem to be the case of the 2XL. I'm right in the dead-spot between the 2XL and the 3XL so I ordered the 2XL assuming that it would loosen up a bit. After using the helmet for a couple of months I can say that it is still just as tight as when I first put it on. I think this is because the padding is all very thin on this particular size of helmet. I think it's a great helmet but I suspect I'll have to spend $$$ replacing it with the proper size after wearing it for as long as I have.\n",

      "Overall this helmet is very well made. It does have a few minor faults.1. The internal visor develops a strange haze on it that requires it to be wiped off. This is really annoying. It doesn't matter if you leave it down or put it up. The haze always appears, normally after riding for a while then stopping off to eat or drink. Then when you take off again it's hazy and you can't see. So it becomes useless. Also happens after being in the rain for a little bit and its up. After rain stops and sun comes back you lower it to find its not usable due to this haze. Air flow does not clear it away.2. Very loud when behind a windscreen. Quiet when not..3. Runs a little small.Overall its a great helmet. Fix the sun visor issue and noise problem, it would be excellent.\n",

It is somewhat oval, IMO, should be comfortable for most majority of riders. Interior padding is nice.Build & Durability: Exceptionally well made. No funky glued on, screwed on bits. No plastic rivets holding the bottom together (see Schuberth).Ventilation: This could be better. The chin vent is effective but I don't feel the top vent adds much.Noise: Average loudness maybe. They did not design it to be slippery (to the wind) where the face shield connects to the body of the helmet. This leads to a fair amount of wind noise at higher speeds. Other: You will have to patiently fiddle with the face shield to get it on and off.\n",

      "I have been a long-time user of Shoei helmets. I rode with the RF900 for years and it was (past) time for an upgrade. I considered the RF1200, but opted for the Shoei Air for its internal sun visor. This has been a great added feature. The visor is nice and dark and goes over my glasses without issue. I also like the pin-lock feature, though it doesn't stop my glasses from fogging up. The air flow is less than I expected, but only marginally so. The vents are easy to operate and offer multi-position openings. My only critique of this helmet is that the first click up on the visor is too high to leave open when in stop and go traffic. My old helmet had a toggle prop to keep it open only a few centimeters. I have installed the Sena 10 communicator in the helmet and it fit like a glove. The ear pockets were deep enough to facilitate the speakers and still left room for my ears.Overall, I find this to be a superior helmet and worthy of the Shoei name.\n",

      "Quality helmet!\n",
      "This is a nice helmet with great features but make sure you have a fit that you like. I have had an awful time getting a helmet that fits right! My head measures just under 60 cm which is at the top end of size large with most manufacturers. Last year I bought a Bell Bullitt size large and it felt good to start with but after wearing it several times I started getting headaches and realized that it was too tight. This year I got the Shoei GT-Air in an extra large. I had an advantage because my brother has the same helmet in a size large that I tried on and it definitely felt tight right away. The extra large felt very good right away, but now after riding several times with that it feels like it might be a little big! If you purchase the Shoei GT-Air and it feels a \"little\" snug at first I don't think that's all bad. It feels to me that there's a pretty good amount of padding there that will break in some. I believe next time I will be trying a helmet made more for a long oval shape to see if that makes a difference. Having said all that, the Shoei GT-Air feels like a quality helmet. I noticed right away that I didn't have any air drag on the helmet, which also made it quieter. I have found myself using the sun visor often! The indentations for holding the visor open are in great locations and are strong enough where your visor isn't going to suddenly blow closed on you. The only drawback is that getting the face shield open that first crack is a little tough, but you soon get used to that and it does serve as a good seal. I have a Sena 20S installed and it works great on this helmet, the ear pockets are nice and deep, and you are able to use the clamp with this helmet.\n",

      "Good but not the best Shoie\n",
      "Just came back from a 2800 mile trip in temps ranging from mid thirties to 106. This baby worked well in the cold with the vents closed. This is my sixth Shoie in a row; my Gary Lawson was the best in the heat. I think that was an RF-1000.On the long ride the visor operated perfectly. I really like it. It saves having to take two visors, a clear and a tinted. The visor does hold out some heat, also.Mine shell is white, due to the heat here and for added visibility. In case you don't know, the Honda ST1300 ambient temperature stops registering at 125. It just blinks '125' above that. You would not know this unless you were sitting on the bike in that heat. If you don't like heat, don't live in Texas. Here is the first downgrade. The airflow is less than Shoie's older models, e.g. RF900 and RF1000. I buy helmets that talk about the amount of air they move. This one is OK but not great for high temps. Also, the vents on this baby seem to add noise; something new to me.The second downgrade: Between the air moving around the shell and the added vent noise this is not the quietest Shoie. The Air is reasonably quiet but (I) still wear ear plugs for extended riding. I can't wait for active sound cancellation on Shoie (hint)..After nine days of putting this on and taking it off my ears were pretty sore. That should not be an issue for a couple or three on/offs a day.The Shoies fits my head and the fit is typical for them. I think I am more round than oblong.I hope my downgrades and comments do not talk you out of Shoie. This is a good helmet and I have trusted my life to them for a long time.

      "I've had Shoei helmets since the 90s and when I got back into riding, I knew where to start looking.I've always like the Shoei shield system and always thought it worked well. I could replace my smoke shield with the clear while wearing the helmet and gloves. After reading multiple reviews, most of which talked about the quiet characteristics of the lid, I pulled the trigger.Pros:Typical Shoei quality.Easy to integrate the Sena 20s.Pinlock shield (a first for me) works very well.Integrated sunshield easy to operate with gloves.Flows adequate air- On a hot day, it's still going to be uncomfortable.Fully removable (and size customizable) liner should extend the life of this pricey helmet.Cons:Whomever decided to move to a \"button\" style strap retention system instead of the D-ring retainer that Shoei used for years needs to be found and beaten. The button on the strap is easy to find, the button on the D-ring strap is WAAAY up in the liner of the helmet. This means that attaching the strap is a consistent pain in the butt, and impossible to do with gloves.The shield is much more fiddly than previous Shoei helmets- I'm unable to remove the shield while wearing the helmet, and even with the helmet off, it was an exercise.This helmet does seem to run a little small- My previous 3 Shoei helmets have all been a comfortable XL, this one is a tight XL. Not dangerously tight, but I don't want to take it off and put it on more than necessary.The breath guard which is supposed to deflect airflow away from the visor is of poor quality. I can't keep it attached to the helmet and I've since lost it. It looks like it has bayonnet fittings that would keep it in place, but once installed, you can remove it by just turning the helmet upside down and it'll fall right out.The visors on Shoei helmets used to have a nice grab tab, which made cracking the visor at a stoplight easy. The tab on this visor is much smaller and harder to get a handle on, especially with gloves on.It might just be me and the fitment of the particular helmet, but I don't notice that this helmet is particularly quiet. Admittedly, I fitted the Sena 20s prior to riding with this lid, but I was expecting a quieter experience. I'd wager that my older Shoei helmets are at least as quiet (if not quieter) than this one.Pricey. My last Shoei came in around $350 or so, and I suppose I was expecting more for another $200. It is a nice, premium helmet, but all of the cons make me like it a little less.Of note:With all of my previous helmets, I've used a dark smoke visor to help prevent sunburn on my nose and face while riding on a bright or hot day. I wasn't thinking when I ordered this one- I liked the idea of not having to swap shields. Unfortunately, my first ride was on a bright, hot day at very slow speeds (motorcycle support for an ACS bike-a-thon) and I left the sun visor down and the clear visor up. My nose got badly sunburned, and I was reminded why I used to like the dark smoke visors. This isn't a crack against the helmet, but is good to know if you're fair skinned like me. Overall, I'm happy with the helmet and will continue to buy Shoei in the future.\n",

      "I bought this to replace my RF 1100. This helmet is lighter and quieter than the 1100. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it comes stock with the Pin Lock system.As others have said purchase one size bigger than you think you should. When I measured myself I was just under a size medium. When it came in I could not fit it over my head.Fortunately the no hassle exchange process was awesome and in just a few days I had the correct size.\n",

      "I have owned this helmet for a few months now. I am very torn on how to rate this helmet overall. The Good and not so bad:This helmet is very quiet. I thought my monster 821 was actually quiet until i cracked the visor open at a light. I can barely hear the bike run until i lean out far and get the engine sound back off the ground. I gauged how close i was to the ground in my old helmet by how loud the engine tone coming back at me was...That is not the case with this helmet. Road noise...other cars...my bike, all are drowned out pretty well. Wind noise isn't bad.Fit and comfort are great for me at least. My head fits in very snug. I'm not sure how my bluetooth will fit in this helmet for this reason. Not well is going to be my guess. The helmet isn't too small, just very snug. I gather the helmet is so quiet in part for how well it fits and insulates my head.Looks, I really love the way it looks. I own it in matte black solid. Matches my monster 821 dark pretty well. Features. The visor is easy to release and re secure with gloves on. No problems finding it, i like that there is no button or release, just a detent that is easy to use. The visor switch is also very easy to find and operate while in motion. The vents are equally as easy to find and adjust.Airflow. Not bad, I was expecting a little more to be honest with how large the intake looks. I find it to be average at best. My other helmet flows better. Its not awful but for the price point i imagined it to be much better.What I Don't Like:Ventilation. Not great while stopped. I have other helmets i don't feel compelled to crack open at every light i sit at for more than a few moments. I feel like i'm suffocating in this helmet at a stop when its above 70 degrees out. It's fairly humid a lot of the time in the area i live in, this helmet does not breathe as well as i would like. Its fine once you get going, but this is a serious issue for me. I don't have this problem with my other helmet.Fog. In piggy backing off the ventilation issue, the next big one is fog. It's terrible. A pin lock is pretty awesome, it keeps the visor totally fog free. Then you drop the shade down and its one big foggy mess inside the helmet. You have perfect vision right until you want to keep the sun out of your eyes. The drop down shade was one of the biggest reasons i purchased this helmet. it was the feature i was after the most and have been greatly let down by it.Between how much this helmet holds the heat /humidity and fogs up with the internal shade lowered...very disappointed. And for how much it costs, thats a very expensive disappointment. This has become my helmet i only use if i think i might stay out passed sun down. I prefer my other helmet to this one. I would definitely not purchase this item again and couldn't recommend it to other riders.\n",

      "I've had two HJC helmets before this and I was tired of the quality so I decided to splurge and get this helmet. I'll never get anything but Shoei again. Yes, it was a but expensive but it more than pays off. I didn't want to have to worry about getting a tinted visor and switching it which is why I picked this one for the visor. I absolutely love it! The noise level is very low and the over all comfort is just incredible once the pads are worn in a few times. I'd recommend this over and over anytime!\n",

      "Overall I am pretty happy with this helmet. Did a lot of research before buying this one and had a pretty clear idea of what I was buying. I bought the helmet because I was looking for a good allround fit, something that looked good and had great safety scores.The helmet fits well, the visor locks very well, the vents work great and drop down sun visor does the trick. No complaints there. This is obviously a solid helmet.One minor issue is the air flow in my particular riding position. I ride a Harley and sit up straight. I thought I had read that this helmet was good for both a sport and touring position but in my experience the helmet is not perfect for when you are sitting up straight. Noise from air flow is way louder than when I tilt my head slightly in a downward facing angle but that makes for an uncomfortable riding position.It is not a huge issue and I would still recommend the helmet for all other features.\n",

On cool mornings, even with the Pinlock in place, it still fogs. The drop down sun visor is great, which is the only reason I purchased this helmet over a Bell Race Star.\n"

      "Round headed buddies: Beware of pain under the ears\n",
      "I consider my head more of a neutral to round shape and I went with the Shoei GT Air but was surprised to know they run a size small. Dont event bother with returns , just order the next size. The disparity is quite large to be honest. I am a size M but L in Shoei. The GT air has great build quality and has a premium look and feel. I wore a size L for 15 minutes and there was no discomfort. At around 20-25 mins I started experiencing intense pain right around my ear lobes and below it on the neck. The padding and shape behind the pads curve inwards more sharply than normal and hence cause this pain. On the second day the pain was reduced obviously due to breaking in but was still quite prominent. I am hoping it will continue to reduce over time because I really love the helmet for its look, feel, air flow and design. The worst case scenario will be to take a billiard ball and roll in the area near the ear cut out. The drop down sun vizor is smooth and provides adequate coverage but might be a tad small if you wear prescription glasses like me. Which brings me to the next point - it didnt hurt wearing the glasses or I did not feel any pressure near the temples. If you are inermediate oval to long shape, go for it, its a great piece of protection. I would suggest people with a more round head shape to try on different helmets before ordering this.\n",

      "If you wear Shoei helmets, this should help you. The XL is usually slightly too big, but in this model it was snug to begin with but breaks in to a really nice fit in 10 hours. Mine is the solid white which makes you very visible to cars. Never understood black helmets. The visibility is good, noise level is about average, strap is comfortable, and the inner pieces come out for cleaning. The face shield is harder to get off and on than my older Shoei. You'll figure it out. This is a good quality helmet. The inner fog free shield really works.\n",

On the road it made my ride a lot more enjoyable on my cruiser. I no longer need the feel for ear plus due to the quietness of this helmet. I also don't feel like the helmet is being pushed up by the wind, and It feels a lot more stable on windy days. The drop down sun visor is a winner. No longer do I need to carry an extra Visor with me (which means I now have extra space in my bags). The air intakes work amazingly well, Its nearly impossible to fog the visor.

But the Pinlock is amazing. It just doesn't fog up, in rain or sitting at lights. So maybe I really don't need the shield detente cracked open!

Jury still out on that one but I digress.This helmet fits great. My first ride out of the box was at 67 degrees no wind. It fogged immediately. The only way to clear it was to crack the shield. I read up on some mitigation efforts and removed the chin spoiler (skirt), installed the pin lock, and changed my windscreen level a touch. Very nice indeed. No Fogging, great vision and the sun shade rocks the whole package. It is very wind worthy and there was no buffeting or effort to look over your shoulder at speed. Noise was greatly reduced from the other helmets in my stable. Ear plugs are the key, mates! Very pleased with the purchase.\n",

Ventilation is top notch as is the visibility and quality. Would have preferred if the Internal sunvisor came a bit lower to cover more field of vision.

I am a size small and when I first tried this on I tried a medium that was comfortable in store but rotated a bit too much on my head. I went with the small and felt general head pressure and claustrophobic for the next 10 hours of riding. It's all broken in now and it feels great! Those cheekpads will break in over time.As for the features:-The sunvisor is great and saves me the hassle of shield changes at night. Also the mech feels solid and low-profile so it wont break-The pinlock shield is awesome, no fog even on the coldest rainiest days, however the sunvisor will fog up-The chin curtain is great and stays in place solidly-This helmet vents a lot of air, but when sealed up it is nice and quiet (AKA the vents actually work unlike a lot of other helmets...)-Feels rock solid on a naked bike at highway speeds, doesn't buffet much at allReally great helmet overall, a huge step up from the cheaper stuff and well worth it.

      "I had a Shoei RF1200 for awhile after hearing everyone rave about it. That is a fantastic helmet. When the Sena 10U came out I decided to get a GT-Air.On long rides with tunnels, the sun visor over sunglasses is really nice. That said, I really prefer sunglasses and an open shield over the sun visor and an open shield. The way air flows around the shield shoots it straight into your eyes. I have to close the outer shield at anything over 35mph. There aren't good channels for the sunglasses arms like on the RF1200 though.It's a bit heavier than the RF1200 but the comfort is still amazing. Really quiet. The chin curtain and a few other components are nicer than the RF1200 too. Also, despite it's name, I think the RF1200 flows air a little better. They're pretty close though.The best part about this helmet is my opinion (besides just being a great Shoei helmet) is the Sena 10U. Having the no-show communicator that's specifically made for it is worth my few gripes with it.If you don't care about a communicator and you don't want a sun visor, I'd get the RF1200. That said, this is still a fantastic helmet. I'd buy it again.\n",

      "I bought this as a replacement to my Nolan 91 (modular) and was looking for a full face that could be worn in the heat of Virginia summers during traffic. I know the comparison of these 2 helmets may be \"apples to oranges\" one, but they're both fruit and I've owned the Nolan for years, so I'll reference it.I think the Shoei GT-Air is slightly overpriced, but they have what I want, so I paid. The assembly and finish are on par with what you would expect from Shoei, although it doesn't exceed what I got from previous Nolan helmet. Fit is so subjective, I'm not going to address it. I'm convinced that buying a helmet without trying it on (for ANY reason) is asking for disappointment. The weight of this Shoei GT-Air, while, nearly as much as my Nolan, had a MUCH better balance to it, so it \"feels\" lighter. The venting is extremely good across the top of the head when moving. As far as vision, I am disenchanted with the fact that Shoei doesn't offer a tinted visor for this helmet in the U.S. I understand there is a drop down internal sun shield and it doesn't lessen my disappointment. I did, however, know this going into the purchase and accepted it a shortcoming. I'm a fan of the Pinlock system and Shoei includes a Pinlock insert with this helmet, which is why I listed the bang for the buck as \"average\" vs \"fair\". As a side note, I think that when you get into helmets of this price point, bang for the buck drops in priority. There are helmets that are equally safe for legal street riding for much better prices.I'm not a racer and 80% of the design features that's mentioned in advertisement and Revzilla review is more minutia to me than pertinent info. The same for SNELL rating. It vents well and most important, it's comfortable. If I tried on a cheaper competitor's helmet that was safe, fit/balanced the same or better and was less expensive, I would've bought it, instead. I did consider an Arai RX-Q, but the venting just didn't compare. I think, however, that coming across a safe helmet that vents this well is a difficult task.Good luck with your choice.\n",

      "This is a well-balanced and comfortable helmet with excellent features. I love the drop-down visor, it's really easy to use and blocks out the sun very well. It's also very appealing to the eye! Only complaint is that the cheek pads are a little tight and my jaw is sore after wearing it for awhile. So if you have a thick jaw, expect tightness.\n",

      "Great helmet... build quality a lot better than my last HJC CL10 helmet. It def feels like a $500 helmet. The large in HJC fits just as well as a large Shoei. The cheeckpads are brain sqeezinlgly tight right now after 10 hours and a growler sitting in it when off head, but Im confident it will loosen up. Airflow is alot more than the CL10, as road noise is reduced greatly also. The Sena 10u fits perfectly. Love my new helmet, wish it was a little bit less expensive.\n",

      "Wish I would have purchased a RF-1200\n",
      "I've been riding for 30 years. I have always worn Shoei helmets. They are by far the most comfortable helmet I've ever put on my head. I feel like my head is very well protected when wearing a Shoei. There wasn't even a question when it came time to purchase a new helmet, that it would be a Shoei.I'm a geek when it comes to wanting/buying stuff with all the latest and greatest features. The main reason I purchased this Shoei was for the retractable sun visor.Just last month, my wife needed a new Shoei and I ended up getting her the RF-1200. I wish I would have bought the 1200 for myself. To me, the GT Air just doesn't feel as \"tough\". Maybe cause it feels \"lighter\" and I know that should be a good thing, but it just leaves me wondering if it's as durable. The finish on my GT, is definitely more fragile than my previous Shoei's and it seems easier to scuff it up.I wish I would have purchased the RF-1200 and just gone with the tinted screen or the new transition screen. I wish it felt as tough as my past/other Shoeis. I still have 4 years before recommended replacement. I ride everyday and hate that I have to live with the regret of not getting something different.\n",

      "Not impressed\n",
      "This is my third Shoei, and I expected better. I'm replacing my aging X-11. I loved everything about the X-11, aside from the wind noise, which I'd hoped to lessen with this GT-Air.Wind noise: The GT-Air isn't too bad with noise, but oddly enough, the chin vent being open increases the low-frequency roar substantially, so much so that once I isolated it as the problem, I pretty much had to keep it closed all the time. The upper vent only adds a minimal amount of noise.About the \"Air\" part. Not so good. The chin vent doesn't seem to provide cooling to my lower face the way my X-11 did. All the venting seems to go up along the face shield. And the \"air mohawk\" they brag about really just seems to be a bit of a cool spot right on the top of my head. All in all, I'd rate the venting as mediocre.Turbulence: There is some lift to this helmet, and with that lift, a bit more burbling than I like. Though the GT-Air looks to have the right aerodynamic spoilers integrated into the design of the shell, they just don't work as well as the racing-style spoilers fitted to my old helmet.Finally, a word about the integrated sun visor: Some people may love this feature. I *wanted* to; it's the reason I bought this helmet, really -- To stop switching back and forth between my tinted shield and clear shield at night. Thing is, the tinted shield did a perfect all-around job of protecting my eyes, while the integrated sun shield has a one-inch gap at the bottom. The means my line of sight to my gauges is clear, and frequently reflecting sunlight back into my eyes. This became so annoying that I stopped using the integrated sun shield for most riding. It works well in dusky light, where switching back and forth is helpful. Aside from that, it's back to sunglasses. Also, with the sun shield down, airflow to the upper face is restricted. Oh, and there's NO option for a tinted main shield with this helmet, since Shoei must have felt it superfluous.I do not recommend this helmet. I'm going to try and dump mine and get an X-12, or perhaps wait for whatever's next.\n",

      "I bought this helmet to replace another ancient Shoei that I owned and had been wearing for WAY too long (10+ years). It does it's job and has the sun visor I was looking for but nothing REALLY stands out good or bad with this helmet to me. It is about the same noise level as my old Shoei, I can't tell the difference in weight. The airflow is a bit better (and the best of the 3 or 4 full face helmets I've owned). Under certain circumstances I can really feel it, but it's not the final answer to being \"too hot\". (Although I guess wearing a helmet in 100*+ weather will never be refreshing.) It does feel secure and protective like my old Shoei, much more so than the (inexpensive) HJC's that I've had and it fits my Sena communicator fine. Bottom line, I would buy it again, but I wish the price was a bit less.\n",

It's been hot and humid here in San Diego and the venting feels minimal. The pin lock feature is nice, preventing fogging. But my drop down sun shield fogs a bit when I'm stopped. Not expected for a helmet I paid $500 for, but it still performs well. It's also very light and aerodynamic in the wind. My head is not shifting around as much at high speeds.

      "I tend to run my helmets for the duration of the 5 year suggested length, as such I was looking for a helmet that I knew would last. I've tried the cheap stuff, the middle of the road and now it was time to swing for the fences.This helmet oozes quality. A friend, who knows nothing about bikes or helmets, commented on how great it looks and that 'it just looks expensive.' Given that my wallet is 5 Benjamins lighter, I'd have to agree.The pads are quite snug, even tight at the start. Getting into it is a bit of...fun. Taking it off requires rope and a team of horses, and the hope that it doesn't tear your ears off. However, with about 20 hours in the helmet it fits like a glove, a snug glove, but a glove, none-the-less. So don't think the cheek pads etc won't 'break in'. They certainly do. Due, to my bony pencil neck I do get an air leak, but seriously, no one's bony like I am, so I wouldn't fret about your average Joe having a quiet ride.The air this thing flows is absolutely redonkuyulus! The top vent is like someone sawed the top of the helmet off, the front vent is A/C for your forehead (not your mouth), and the rear vent almost makes a sucking sound with the way it filters the air out of the helmet...even if the other two vents are closed.The drop down visor is great and doesn't hit my nose. It's a dark smoke drop down, not a UV~ish blue~ish color that some other helmets have.The seal from the visor to the 'lip' is pretty good, and they even given you a small silicon oil bottle to ensure it stays good. Line the 'lip' with this for further wind/water protection.The Pinlock for it is really nice, as well. It covers your whole viewing area, pretty much and I just keep mine on as it seems I'm a mouth breather and even the breath guard can't stop me from fogging up the visor without it on. I don't care, though.All in all, so far, it's a great helmet and I have no regrets. It's a bit odd wearing a modular EXO-900 for 7 years and then going full face. Full face don't take too kindly to you trying to put them on over your eyeglasses. >_> I needed something for track and street duty, though. (And my track doesn't care about a SNELL rating. If your does, this is not the helmet for you. Try the RF11/1200 or X series.)\n",

      "Quality Equipment!\n",
      "I set out to find a helmet that was quiet, comfortable, and safe. Shoei delivered. I was torn between the GT-Air and the RF-1200 and ultimately went with the GT Air due to the built in sun visor. A small perk, but key. Having the integrated sun visor in the helmet is clutch and the ability to toggle it down/up with the left hand is awesome.The helmet itself is comfortable: the first time I wore the helmet, I was concerned that it was too small - the fit was tight. There's an initial break-in period, then after that, no problems. The fit is snug and secure. The cheek pads and interior lining and can be removed and cleaned.The airflow is fantastic: the chin vent and head vents provide excellent airflow. Also included is an interior breath guard to help mitigate breathing out into the helmet while the visor is down.The GT-Air offers wide and unparalleled vision to see whats going on around you.In terms of sound, you will obviously hear much more wind with the vents open. Without ear plugs, the general level of sound that enters through the helmet is low. Earplugs + GT-Air = very quiet.The helmet is ease to keep clean and tip-top. All in all, 5 stars.\n",

      "Let's get the pros in first (I am coming from an RF-1100 helmet size medium)Visibility is great, feels markedly better than the RF-1100Drop down sun visor is a good tint and also easily accommodates glasses behind it. Long haired riders note: when the visor is down it does funnel a fair amount of air down and I found myself tucking hair out of the way often.Style is great, a good looking step up from the RF.However, for a 500 dollar helmet I noticed a couple things I have some gripes about.Ventilation didn't seem great to me. This might be dependent on the cheek and head liner (see below) but thus far I'm underwhelmed by the amount of air flow i'm feeling in this lid anywhere from 40 to 90 mph.A very quiet helmet as far as the engine noise is concerned, but not so much the wind buffeting you over 70 mph. The RF-1100 seems more democratic to me over 70 mph as far as allowing you to hear the engine as much as the wind. I'd actually prefer to hear the engine so I know what the bike is doing.BUT (and here is the biggest BUT) that could be related to the cheek and head liners that ship in this helmet. The medium RF-1100 fit me perfectly. The GT-Air is so tight I started to get a headache/jaw pain over the weekend (250 mile-ish ride to break it in required a couple stops because the discomfort was so distracting) Shoei offers cheek and head pads of different sizes, but as I paid 500 bucks for the helmet I'm not jazzed about having to shell out another 100 bucks or so to get the liner right. Shoei ought to offer one exchange upon purchase so you can get the sizing right for the insides. I'm hoping that once I have a little more space inside this helmet I will hear the engine a bit more over 70. I'll update this review once I get liners.At this point I'm feeling like my money would have been better spent on an X-Twelve as a second helmet even though it's race-track oriented.\n",

If im paying 500$ for a helmet, I expect it to be lined with something besides that scratchy stuff. The overall fit didn't jive with me, and that's just me, but one thing that drove me NUTS was the pockets for the blutooth speakers. there were little to no insterts, so if you wanted to wear headphones, there was this void by your ears. I cant count how many times Ive had to take my helmet off on the side of the road to readjust my headphones after they got loose. with a blutooth set, its great im sure, but the last thing I want when im riding is to be bothered on the phone. My previous helmets were tight enough around my entire head, and in all the right places, to where the helmet would keep my earbuds in. personally, I just don't like this helmet. not a fan at all. Its too much for too little.\n",

      "I've owned the helmet for 2 years now. The name \"air\" is really should be \"no air\". Therefore, out of the 4 helmets that I owned, this is the most quiet. I've played several times with the vent system to see if I was misusing the adjustment levels but, unfortunately, this helmet gets no ventilation, period. I purchased the helmet with the intention to use it in Hawaii. I should have read more reviews before doing so. Compared to my two Arai and RF110 helmets, this one I use the most in the winter.

      "I love this lid. Lots of vents, interior sunshield, included Pinlock Lens (not installed), Emergency Cheekpad release, and it comes in bright yellow. All these features and it's comfortable and quiet. The top vents move air like I don't believe, over 60 mph I have to go 1/2 open on the intake to avoid being too cool. I bought this helmet and wore it around town for a week before I took a 1500 mile tour around western Montana. This helmet saw wind, thunderstorms, hail, 90+ degrees, and about a billion dead bugs. I'm so glad I spent the money on a premium brand. It looked expensive sitting in my shopping cart, but you definitely get what you pay for. My previous helmet was an HJC AC-12 so I thought helmets were just helmets, but not this one. The fit is perfect, I measured at about 24\" and got the XL and it is packing out quite nicely. I'm of Northern European descent and found the shape of the helmet to be excellent, no front pressure like I found on HJC's and the Arai RX-Q.The only bummer is it doens't have SNELL rating because of the sunshield. For me this was an acceptable trade off because I don't go to track days, and the flexibility achieved by being able to quickly flip up and down a tinted lens behind a clear shield is and was invaluable to me. No more messing about with sunglasses inside my helmet, just a flip of a switch if I'm ever in heavy trees, behind a mountain, in a tunnel, etc. If you want SNELL and aren't sure you want a sunshield then save ~$70 and get the RF1200.\n",

      "I bought the GT Air as a replacement for my aging Shark RSR2. This will be my fourth new helmet -- three different brands -- since I got back into motorcycling almost 20 years ago.I did a lot of research before I bought. Based on that research, I narrowed my choice to three helmets, and I tried each of them on at local retailers. The most important factor in my choice was comfort. I have a \"longish oval\" head shape, primarily because I have a long nose, and I've had trouble with my nose rubbing against the chin bar on previous helmets I've used. Even though the other helmets I tried on were advertised as \"intermediate oval\" shapes, my nose bumped the chin bar on them. Not so with the GT Air. It fit my head shape very well.The next most important factor for me was the presence of speaker pockets. Not all helmets have them. I have an Interphone F4 system, and with my RSR2, the speakers rubbed against my ears uncomfortably. I wanted to be able to \"hide\" the speakers for greater comfort. The GT Air has speaker pockets, and they work well. It took a bit of fiddling to mount the speakers into the pockets and then to conceal them, but I managed to figure that out and the speakers don't present a comfort issue.I really like the idea of a sun visor, and the GT Air was the only helmet I tried on that had one. It was an important part of my selection decision.I had a 200-mile Sunday ride last week which gave me the opportunity to test the GT Air on the road for the first time. I was immediately struck by how light the helmet felt, and how much air flowed through it at speed. The ambient temperature was in the 90s, but the helmet felt cool on the inside when I was moving. None of my previous helmets moved this much air. My only complaint with air flow is it took some experimentation to figure out what port positions corresponded to \"open\" and \"closed\". That became obvious after I got underway.The visor easily moved up and down with a gloved hand. I didn't wear sunglasses and didn't need them, except I did notice that when I glanced down at my gauges, I wasn't looking through the visor and there was some glare from the sun. It would be nice if the visor was a bit \"longer\", but I don't think this will be a problem, since I only occasionally glance at the gauges while underway.The helmet is difficult for me to put on and take off. I was careful to choose the correct size -- a large. It fits snugly, like it's supposed to, and when I get it on properly, it's very comfortable. The problem is I initially got my ear folded down awkwardly inside the helmet. I didn't realize that right away and ended up riding about 100 miles with my ear folded. It became painful after awhile, but I didn't have a safe place to stop and adjust it. On the return trip, I was more careful to get it on properly and had no problems with comfort. This is not a problem with the helmet, it's a problem with my ability to put it on, and I have to get that figured out.This is definitely not a cheap helmet, but it's not the most expensive one, either, and it fit me better than one that was quite a bit more expensive. I think it's a good value for the money.I bought mine in Brilliant Yellow, and together with my chartreuse and black riding suit, I'm hoping for maximum visibility.\n",

      "I'm only giving this two stars because it (presumably) does its job of protecting my head. Beyond that, it's been massively disappointing. I came from a Nolan flip up that I loved, but it was ruined by water. I've been hearing about Shoei for years, and I could finally afford one, and hoped for greater noise reduction. This will likely be my first and last Shoei helmet.Pros: It protects my head(?!). The sun visor works.Cons: I put this on and it smelled like house paint. Not that nice \"new helmet smell\". House. Paint. I figured it would dissipate after a while. I still smell it after 1.5 years. The mechanics on the visor and vents are stiff, and I really have to work to pinch open the visor, and the snap lock doesn't allow for any extra circulation or anti-fogging that I've noticed, it just makes it harder to get open. I figured this would break in and get easier. It's still annoying. Same for the vents. Too stiff. And the chin vent, as far as I can tell, offers no ventilation at all. Which brings us to the Pinlock, which is a joke. I wore this helmet to Patagonia - Argentina and Chile, with the full spectrum of weather and temperature, and I ended up not only taking out the fogged up pinlock (yes, it was properly installed when I got the helmet), but having to leave the visor open while riding in the rain and mud so I could see without the fogged up visor. So a pricey helmet that requires a pinlock for anti-fogging that has to be installed by its new owner, and doesn't work. I'm unconvinced.Wind noise. A big reason I got this was to reduce wind noise, especially after coming from a flip up helmet, which are typically noisier than full face. Patagonia is known for being windy, so it was the perfect testing grounds. I couldn't comfortably ride in this helmet without earplugs. Maybe I need a thicker neck to close the bottom, but the noise was intolerable for me.Also, the strap is ye olde DD rings, rather than a ratchet strap, which I prefer.Other than that, hey, it's better than going without a helmet.\n",

The bike took to long for repair (some parts coming from Germany) and a broken Scapula took a while to rehab. Not to mention 6 busted ribs.The time I have ridden with all vents open the GT-Air does seem much louder than the Quest. I ride looking over the windshield to insure good air flow over the helmet.I ride a BMW R1200RT and air flow is minimal at best behind the windshield.The G-T Air has considerably more air flow over the top of the head and thru the helmet than the Quest.The increase of noise is a small trade off for increase in air flow to keep the top of my head cooler.\n"

      "I transitioned form a 707 Vendetta helmet and I wanted another one with an internal sun visor. The sun visor on the Shoei is way superior and covers a much better part of my face.As far as air flow, it's okay with the face shield closed and all vents open traveling at speed.The included PinLock system is fantastic. I have never had a fogging issue and although it says not to use at night, I don't find the small amount of light reflections a problem.My complaints - the visor cannot be cracked open. It's either fully closed or open around an inch or so. So if you want more ventilation it's either a blast of air or just deal with the built in vents.Also, I found that after an hour of riding, my cheeks started to hurt intensely (feels fine for trips under an hour) enough that I have to take off the helmet. I'm hoping they will break in more, otherwise I might have to purchase the slimmer cheek pads Shoei makes.\n",

      "This is my first helmet, but I'm really liking it. The fit is very good, and the materials are top notch. Having the Pin Lock included is a very nice feature & helps keep the visor from fogging. I did have to remove the chin curtain as riding in weather around 40 deg F would cause my glasses to fog up.\n",

      "I loved my RF1100, but when it came to features, it was a bit lacking. This GT-Air gives me a built in sunshade and pinlock, making it perfect for year-round commuting and fun riding. I didn't have to spend $50 on an aftermarket pinlock, and I didn't have to spend $50 on an extra dark smoke shield. I'd say the extra cost for those features isn't really an extra cost at all if you'll actually use them. Fit is snug, just like the 1100 was when it was new, so I expect it to wear in about the same as well.\n",

      "I've had my GT Air for about a month and is by far the best helmet I've ever owned. Had an RF1100 and a couple HJC's and this is by far my favorite. Very comfortable, head-checks well, minimal buffeting at speed, relatively quiet for a helmet with the sun-visor. The actuation of the sun-visor is by far the best of any of the ones I've experienced. Most feel cheap and floppy, this one is very solid and smooth. One of my two complaints is I seem to be a bit between sizes. I got an XL which seemed plenty snug when I tried it on, but as it's broken in I can sometimes feel it getting pushed farther back on my head when bucking a headwind at 70mph+. The other complaint is that there isn't a good \"city\" position for the face shield. It's either fully locked, all the way down but not locked (maybe open 1mm if that) or one notch up which is open a good 15-20mm. This is annoying in hot weather because at city speeds (c. 40-50mph) it makes my eyes water having it open one click up and there's not enough airflow just leaving it unlocked. I wish it had the locking lever like my RF1100 did, because you could prop it open just 5-6mm which was perfect for around town. Other than that it's incredibly well built and engineered, in typical Shoei fashion.\n",

      "This is only the third helmet I've owned, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. My first two helmets were from a more budget conscious brand, and they worked fine for my first four years of riding. But when it came time to get my next helmet, I was able to afford to be a little pickier. I did a fair amount of online research, and tried on a bunch of helmets, and this one simply fit my head the best - pure and simple. The drop down sun visor was a huge bonus, and definitely my favorite feature so far. I haven't yet tried the pin-lock inner shield yet, but I will shortly as I experienced a little fogging during my last chilly morning ride. The noise level is definitely improved over my previous helmets, which is nice since I don't feel the need to wear earplugs anymore while riding. And as a pretty safety-conscious person, I really appreciate the emergency quick release system if my helmet did ever need to be removed in a worst case scenario.My only complaint, and this is pretty nit-picky, is that the securing snap on the tail end of the chin strap seems harder to snap down than on my previous helmets, but I suspect this will get better over time.Overall, I'm very pleased with this helmet, and while definitely towards the more expensive end of the spectrum, I'm glad I invested in it.\n",

      "Great fit, finish and features\n",
      "This is a great helmet with high quality materials and is very comfortable to wear. I love the drop down visor. However, it has a low frequency howl at speeds above 40 mph. This is diminished almost completely if I ride with my mouth open a little since the noise seems to be coming from my chin area and how it mates and seals with the bottom padding in the helmet. Wearing ear plugs and/or tilting the helmet up or down while riding doesn't help. This may also be aggravated by not having a windshield. I can't blame this on the helmet since it's probably due to my chin being too narrow or some related issue with my head shape. I hate to spend the extra $ to try a different cheek pad size to find out if that fixes it or not. Ultimately, it's still quieter and seals out the cold way better than my old modular HJC. I plan to experiment with placing some foam shims behind the padding to see if I can seal it better around my chin and eliminate the howl.\n",

      "This is a great helmet, don't get me wrong. I have had this for over a year now and have worn it for thousands of miles, a lot of that being on interstates. This will move so much air it leaves parts in your hair!The downside for me, is I am on a sports-touring bike in a very upright position. It makes the vent very noisy even with plugs in. If you have a sports bike with a 3/4 tuck riding position, don't think twice, GET THIS helmet. I can tilt my head down a little like it would be on a sports bike and it goes completely silent, sadly I cant really ride that way.Features are great, the pinlock shield works as it should, the fit is perfect (had to get the smaller cheek pads). Love the internal sun visor, I will only buy helmets with that feature from now on.You can tell this is a very high quality helmet, no complaints about it what so ever, it just doesn't suit my sitting position sadly.Paint has held up great too, couple little scuffs from being dropped in the house, but that happens, and it was my fault.I ride a 2012 Kawasaki Concours 1400 with handlebar risers.\n",

I am hoping the cheek pads will break in or I will try the smaller cheek pads which I ordered. It works as advertised very nicely.I can feel the extra weight of the drop down sun visor in the top front of the helmet compared to my other Shoeis and Arais. Not bad but noticeable.The biggest negative is when I look to check my mirrors I am looking just below the sun visor. Or to put it another way the sun visor is partly in and partly out of my line of sight. This interferes with a clear view of the image in the mirror. I am hoping I will get used to this. The sun visor is as low as it could go without touching my nose.Other than the view of my mirrors I am satisfied with every other aspect of the helmet. I have a Shoei Quest which I like very much. I got the GT Air for the drop down visor. Other than having the visor I am not sure I could say the GT Air is any better than the Quest. Both very good helmets.\n",

      "Great touring helmet, but......\n",
      "moving up from my XR1000, I wanted an integrated visor and was hoping it would be a bit quieter since I just moved to my first naked bike. It is certainly no quieter, and could even be a bit louder since I think the larger shell (to accommodate the internal visor) promotes a bit of resonance. This would be worth noting for those on 4-cylinder machines.That said, it is steadier in wind and lighter as well as being more far comfortable. I did have to buy the thicker internal liner to get the correct fit, which is a bit rich at this price point and should be a no-charge option when purchasing. Ventilation is great. Vision is noticeably better than my XR1000 but the pinlock system doesn't have me convinced. As the main guard against fogging, it seems a bit pointless that the pinlock inserts are \"only to be used in daytime...\" The extra lens creates a lot of glare at night, but without it the visor fogs up immediately. Dissappointing. This is a medium as my last shoei was but the shell looks and feels a full size larger. This took some getting used to. This is definitely a touring/open road riding helmet only. It's a bit bulky for the track or commuting. The fit is a bit relaxed to be a true race helmet anyway.Expensive, but great quality and feels like it will last well. Recommended if you have to have a shoei for the fit as I do but at this price point there are plenty of options out there.\n",

      "My first helmet was a Scorpion EXO-500. That was an okay helmet, but when I upgraded to the GT-Air, I could right away tell why one was more expensive than the other. The GT-Air felt lighter and didn't feel as 'cheap' as the EXO-500 (not saying the EXO-500 is a cheaply made helmet). Very comfortable for extended periods of riding with no neck strain after 6 hours of continuous riding. The internal visor is awesome and I end up having to use a lot, but I had that in my EXO-500 so nothing I'm not used to.I crashed at about 40mph due to cold tires and debris, sliding on the ground until I hit the curb back-of-the-head-first. As soon as I hit the curb I was in shock and expected to be badly injured but telling myself that I couldn't feel it because I was in shock and because of adrenaline (it's a weird feeling, can't really explain it) - but after a few seconds went by I realized that I am completely fine and can't feel any head pain because there wasn't any thanks to the helmet completely absorbing the impact. Even though my head hit hard, there was just a tiny scuff mark or two where my head hit (I think if it wasn't a matte finished helmet it would've been worse). That same impact without a helmet would've easily meant a hole in my skull.So maybe I was feeling like I overpaid for a helmet when a cheaper helmet would've served me fine - and if I wasn't convinced that it was worth every penny just from the added comfort and build quality, it was definitely justified after crashing.I installed a Sena SMH10R in my GT-Air and it fits perfectly as the helmet has extra room specifically for speakers. I hid all the wiring and the battery pack inside the liner in strategic areas that wouldn't compromise safety and protection ability.Don't even think about it - get this helmet. It's great for being on a naked bike or a faired bike that gives a lot of wind buffeting like mine (if wind buffeting isn't an issue, consider an RF1200 instead - supposedly it's very similar to the GT-Air but without the internal visor and thus SNELL approved).P.S. If there was one con, I would say it's that you can't get a tinted shield for it in the U.S. because it's considered illegal for use with a helmet that already has an internal visor. However, if you still want one (for offroad use only of course), you can find them online where they ships from countries where they're not illegal.\n",

      "I had to get the larger cheek pads. I was getting a lot of movement on the highway. The bigger pads fit the bill nicely.My only gripe is that I wish they offered the light smoke full visor instead of just the clear, just to take the edge off of what the internal visor doesn't block. On that note, the internal visor has an odd profile. It seems as if the edges at the extreme right and left should be lower.\n",

The materials feel good against your skin. You can definitely feel airflow on top of you head when the top vent is open.

The optical quality and tint level of the sun visor are excellent and riding at low speed in town, etc., with the clear visor open and the sun visor down is quite comfortable. It's also terrific in the mountains when you're going in and out of the sun, and as the sun sets. It's so nice not to have to stop and change your visor and it's easy to operate on the bike.I feel like it fogs a little at stoplights if I don't open the face shield, but then again I haven't installed the pinlock anti-fog lens that came with it, so I guess that's on me. $500 is a lot for a helmet, but I also have a thousand dollar Ruby and compared to that, the GT Air is a steal.\n",

The built-in sun visor was a big selling point, as well. This helmet is definitely quieter than my old one, and fits just as well. I haven't had a chance to evaluate the air flow, as we're still in the colder months here in Texas, but I'm hoping it will help with the summer heat. The chin skirt is great, too, and really helps with keeping the cold air from coming up into the helmet. On really cold days, with the chin skirt in and the shield closed, I've found that the shield fogs easily. The solution is to crack open the shield to allow a little air, but the first detent is further out than I would like, as it lets too much air in; this is my only complaint, so far, about the helmet.\n",

Normally need thicker cheek pads for perfect fit with Shoei. GT-air pads however fit nice and snug. Helmet a little more difficult to put on/take off. Roughly same weight as old 1000; I suspect RF1200 is a little lighter. Similar wind noise as RF, with added occasional whistling others have mentioned. I have \"noisy\" windscreen on bike; earplugs needed. Only about 50 miles of chilly test ride so far.The good:typical high quality. Definitely feel cool airflow across top of head. Noticeable difference with each setting of top vent positions. Sun shade very handy. Generally shade covers area you're looking through.Clarity through the two shields and my prescription glasses better than I expected. Sun shade easy to clean while installed.The not so good:Chin vent MUST be open to prevent shield fogging while riding (haven't tried pinlock insert yet). Shield must be opened slightly to prevent fogging in stop & go traffic.Gap between bottom of sun shield and top of chin bar. Low sun from behind reflecting off mirrors/instruments. Must tilt head down slightly to block with sun shield. Outer clear shield more difficult to remove/install for cleaning. Chin strap end securing strap difficult to use. Maybe time/practice will helpGenerally happy with purchase. Often run into rising/setting sun on commute. Won't have to pull over and change shields anymore. Also, fun, twisty bits on weekend rides mostly too heavily shaded for tinted shield. Moveable sun shield will improve vision there.\n",

      "I looked at high end helmets from Shuberth but they did not fit my head properly. The Schuberth large fits a (58/59) and the XL fits a (60/61). Of course I am a 59.5cm head so the Schuberth size XL has too much wiggle room and makes my head look gigantic. The Schuberth large had a big pressure point on my forehead, very uncomfortable. The Bell full face helmets also did not fit me comfortably - they seemed too narrow. Then I tried the Shoei GT Air, and it fit like a dream. Turns out their sizing runs different - Shoei measures their sizes with different intervals, so I actually fit into the Shoei Large size (the middle of the three different shell sizes for their helmets). Perfect! No gigantic head profile either with the Shoei! Very happy with the comfort and airflow on this helmet (only rode it about 500 miles so far). The fit, finish, and features including the pinlock anti-fog visor and dropdown internal sunshield makes this helmet an excellent value. It's still pricey, but I wanted a full-face helmet that can do it all, and the Shoei GT Air delivers! Excellent peripheral vision while wearing this helmet, and the pinlock visor does not obstruct my field of vision sitting upright or in a mild tuck (an issue with other helmets).

So I opted to try the GT Air. While I miss some of the high end features of my last helmet, the fit and finish of this helmet is what you'd expect from a Shoei. The vents took a little getting used to and the helmet is a little noisier than I am used to, but the air flow is good and a pair of ear plugs solve the other issue. The real selling point of the helmet is the interior visor. I used to have to switch my visors out when I drove home at night and now, all I have to do is reach over and slide the lever to bring down my interior shield. The lower edge was a little distracting at first, but after a few rides I don't notice it at all and LOVE the glare protection. Totally worth the price and highly recommend buying from Revzilla.

      "This is my first Shoei purchase and I'm very happy with it after just a couple of weeks riding in it. Placed into reserve with the purchase of this GT Air is my 2011 Arai RX-Q. Nothing wrong with the RX-Q, I just wanted an internal sun visor in a helmet with removeable liner and cheek pads. This is also my first helmet with a pinlock lens and I'm enjoying that on these crisp fall mornings; no fogging.This GT Air is a few unnoticeable ounces heavier than the RX-Q. Since I'm never on the track, both helmets feel about the same to me with regards to aerodynamics - and the non-Snell rating of the Shoei becomes a non-issue. Both helmets also seem to me to be about the same with noise level. The GT Air's venting scheme seems to work very well and the return of hot weather will really tell the tale of venting effectiveness. I will say Anthony's description of a \"... Mohawk of air...\" is no exaggeration; excellent air flow. For now the GT Air is nice and warm in the chill with vents closed. The chin vent is very effective in operating in the advertised manner of driving air over the faceshield to my forehead.I like the faceshield and it is easy to remove and replace in short order. I can remove and replace the faceshield on my Arai in about 10 seconds. The Shoei takes about the same amount of time. But this brings me to the internal sunvisor.The internal sunvisor was a deciding factor in buying the GT Air. It works as well as advertised and I like not being compelled to change face shields.The interior of the helmet is comfortable and snug. I change the cheek pads out for thinner ones and that has improved comfort and will break-in nicely.My only complaints: I think the sun visor ought to drop down about 1/4 inch further because it leaves a band of unfiltered light sweeping around its bottom edge, In this same area runs the silicone bead of the pinlock lens making this strip of light kind of busy in the daylight when glancing at the instrument panel. I know that with more time in this helmet my two minor complaints will fade into being un-noticed.Thus far I give the GT Air an \"A\" rating. Falling short from an \"A+\" due to my two minor complaints.\n",

      "My first helmet ever, so I have no reference, but here are my impressions. For me the best feature is the visor. It has a total quality feel, snaps in multiple positions, has a low (\"city\") open position and feels very tight.. there is zero chance you will loose a detent. Visor itself is crystal clear. The sunvisor has a smooth feel in operation, comes down very far. The overall angle of vision is almost (within %95) of my actual eyesight FOV. The air flow is limited to a central portion of your head, but anything above 40mph you can really feel it flow! It goes from the chin vent up, but the top has huge cooling. It is light, not super light, but very good. Overall, its quality and you can really feel it. I wish they had a high viz solid... but oh well.\n",

      "not a quiet helmet\n",
      "I decided to replace my year old Shoei Qwest helmet (it had been badly scratch in an encounter with barbed wire) with something more quiet and with a sun visor. After reading any & all the reviews I could find, I chose the Shoei GT air over the Schubert.-The sun visor works great. In Arizona we ride often with bright sun in our eyes early AM or late PM to avoid the peak heat. And in very bright sun you can easily wear sun glasses behind the visor too.-Noise wise I was surprised how much wind noise and turbulence there was. On my next outing I swapped the 2 helmets a few times on the same ride. Definitely the GTAir was certainly no quieter than the older QWest & a much cheaper helmet in spite of the extra padding the GT had. That was a big disappointment!It could be because the airflow from the motorcycle windscreen hits right at the top of my forehead & hits the helmet right at the air vent. I am 6'1\" and ride high. In any case I am getting a Ilium lip on top of the windscreen & that should resolve the issue by lifting the air flow an inch or more. But still, it is not a quieter helmet & I wish I had not bought it.-The air circulation inside the helmet is very strong and the cooling effect is good. Unfortunately the air flow hits in one spot on the top of the skull & after an hour or more riding that spot gets numb & painful.\n",

      "This is my third Shoei helmet, previously I had a RF1200 and before that an RF1100. This is by far the quietest, most comfortable helmet I've owned. The integrated sun shield visor is a great addition to what was already a great helmet. The vents are much easier than previous models to open and close while wearing gloves and are very effective. The chin vent provides great airflow over the inside of the shield keeping it clear until the rain is really coming down. It isn't cheap but still a great value.\n",

      "I've got almost nothing bad to say about this helmet. Easily my favorite Shoei, and I've been an X-11 wearer for years, on the street, racetrack, and touring. The drop-down visor is absolutely key. Quiet, too.My only gripe is that the locking \"mechanism\" isn't really a mechanism, it's just a molded plastic indent where a little lip on the visor locks into place. Unfortunately, after only a few weeks of use, something changed about the way the lip on the visor sits in the locking groove on the chassis, and now I can't lock the visor using the provided tab on the visor itself, as you're supposed to be able to do. It's like the leverage has changed. Now, if I want to lock the visor, I have to push down on the top edge of the center of the visor. Then it will click. I've swapped out visors, so the visor is not the problem.\n",

      "I just got back from a 3500 mile road trip from Washington state to Arizona and back so I feel that I'm now able to give an honest review: I'm 6'1\" 240 lbs with a more oval than round head. Ride is a 2013 Yamaha FJR with the factory size windshield which I rode with at the lowest position the majority of the trip.The GT Air performed perfectly. Has excellent air flow across the top of my bald head which definitly helped in 100 degree weather. The sun visor has the perfect amount of tint even while riding into the sun. Face shield has plenty of positions to regulate air flow. Plenty of room for a microphone on the chin bar even with a Jay Leno chin, all other helmets that I've worn would push into my chin.I had zero pressure points on my head and cheecks. Cheek pads might be a little to snug making it a only slight challenge to talk on my Scalla Rider without biting my cheeks but I got used to it.I think the next cheek pad size might make it too loose. Overall this helmet is perfect for me I rode 970 miles in one day and my head still was comfortable . I only have one complaint is that while putting on the helmet the liner in the back always likes to come unsnapped. Other than that worth every penny.\n",

      "Shoei is killing it, in terms of modern design, as compared to other makers (like Bell), and they seem to know just where/how to build in in cut-outs and channels for comfort and airflow. Head checks put zero strain on my neck, so that's great, too!This helmet is very light and very quiet (I'm coming from Nolan 90s). I ride a V-Strom, and with the stock windscreen, around town, no earplugs are needed for a quiet ride. I still wear 'em for prolonged highway rides. Speaker pockets are perfect with the Sena SMH10 Bluetooth device, and install is easy.Maybe my head is more oval than I thought, but it's tight. I size at the upper range of the Medium. I'm only about 20 hours into it, and it continues to break in. Those with larger ears or pronounced ears need to be careful putting it on/off.I am used to a modular helmet but did not want to spend so much for the Neotec... this GT-Air was the perfect compromise, and I only miss the opening feature of the modular when stopped at a light on a hot day.BTW - Revzilla continues to get ALL of my business due to the patient and savvy phone advisors. It's clear that they know their products and love their jobs. Thanks, team 'Zilla!\n",

      "Great helmet. At first I thought I was going to have to return it because it was VERY, VERY snug (I had tried one on in my size, M, in a store for about 10 minutes). I wore it in the house for an hour and got a nasty headache. After that I wore the helmet for about 20-30 minutes at a time a couple of times a day for about 3 days and then decided it was going to work. Took the stickers off and took it out on the bike. PERFECT fit. Don't be surprised if your new helmet is painfully tight at first, it will break in. My previous helmet was an HJC AC-12 Carbon and I have also worn the Arai Profile helmets, so if the Profile fits your head shape this should too. This helmet has the best combination of quality, comfort, style, and features. The drop down sun visor is amazing. I wear glasses and no longer have to switch to sunglasses or a tinted visor. The pinlock is amazing. Airflow is great. Eye port is big. The only things I don't like are that graphic versions are overpriced (I bought a plain white) and the snap for the end of the strap is a little high up, making it difficult to snap. I started using my left hand to snap it and no more issues. Highly recommended.\n",

Even new and tight , I had no points of pressure, it had an even gentle squeeze.Fits my head well, my old HJC IS16 was a bit too round for my head. This one is more oval.Very quiet with chin curtain in. Above 70 degrees and its too hot for me to wear chin curtain. This is on a R1200RT in full ATGATT. Not real noisy with chin curtain out, I always wear earplugs.Vision is awesome, quality shields for sure. Good detents on main shield. Sunshield actuator has no detents, but stays in place. I put black tape on top edge on sunshield to act like a visor on a ball cap, works well.Venting is good.Good finishI would buy again, but would hope new model is lighter..\n",

At full tuck you can really feel it, otherwise the flow is there, but not as strong as I'd like it. Also the airflow through the mouthpiece is almost non existent. The flip down tinted visor is a great addition as well. Lets you keep the clear visor for night/ low light riding and with a simple slide of a button you have direct sunlight protection. I've ridden into the sun with no problems with this visor. All in all great helmet, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.\n",

      "I had been borrowing a helmet from a friend. Sometimes I would have to pull over to put on sunglasses. Or I would have to pull over to take them off. Or I would struggle to see when I pulled in a parking garage. Or I would be blinded when the sun came out from behind the clouds. No longer.I'm new to motorcycles. I don't appreciate the Shoei name like everyone else seems to because I dont' know motorcycle gear. I just *love* that I can raise and lower the shades as my environment changes throughout my ride. I would likely be happy with another vendor if they had this shade I could raise and lower easily with a gloved hand.The helmet looks nice, I'm more of a function over form kind of guy so I don't really care that much about appearance.I'm a bit sad that it fogs up on me. All the research I've done indicated the pinlock visors are not supposed to fog up. At this point I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong.Sound seems to be reasonable when I'm communing. The wind gets loud when I'm going 70+ MPH but is not unreasonable.Wish it was cheaper. Seems a bit more expensive than other helmets.Helmet is extremely comfortable for me. Recommended.\n",

      "This is actually my first shoei and I have to say I'm really happy with the purchase. The helmet is more quiet than my former AGV. Among the pluses of the helmet are the pinlock visor, the good positive lock on the visor and all the vents, as well as the sun visor that switches down. I thought that it might be overkill, but honestly, if you are looking for an all weather touring helmet, I can't imagine one without the sun visor. No need to bother with sunglasses that add pressure on the temples. Just flip the switch and voila! The chin vent is actually nicely turned towards the inside of your visor, which in this model seems to work really well. There were two shoei stickers that I carefully removed as a personal preference. The curtain is very comfortable and works well in cold weather, but it is also removable for the summertime. There seems to be a bit of wind noise that can get loud, but that really depends on the exact path of the air on your specific motorcycle. I overcame this issue by adding the tiniest flap, home-made using some red sugru. Overall, the helmet is rather quiet, an observation that is apparent when switching back and forth from other helmets. Definitely happy with this purchase.\n",

      "I have broken this helmet in now and I love it. Such a high difference during windy rides. You definitely need to find the right position for the helmet to be super quiet but I'm pleased with the sound deadening. I tried using the oil provided by Shoe and that was a mistake. Any time the visor is up the oil collects small particles. When you put it down it begins to scratch the sided where it hits the rubber seal. It doesn't impact vision but I'm just slightly confused about why they want you to use it in the first place. Also, I absolutely love the pi lock but it hits the rubber seal when you try to crack the visor open which makes it difficult to open. I would imagine over time this will wear down and need to be replaced.All that being said, I've done 2 8 hour road trips with this helmet and it was amazing. Never minded putting the helmet back on, no sore neck, no hot spots. Highly recommended\n",

My previous helmet Ivy2 was so inferior aerodynamically that my head was constantly being buffeted moved around. Highway speed head checks were almost scary at times. It was so bad I was looking to ugrade in wind protection for my bike. However, the GT air has largely eliminated this problem. The fit is tight, but comfortable. I didn't think the helmet is as quiet as advertised, but this is going to depend on the rider and bike. I noticed slight changes in head tilt effect the noise inside the helmet. With head tilted forward as on a sport bike, the helmet is quiet. Also, air flow could have been better specifically through the chin guard. Again, by putting your head straight up, the air flow through the chin guard improves, but with a slight forward tilt it is not enough. The pinlock insert works very well and is definitely needed. Without it, the visor fogs up immediately. Shoei should have allowed for more air flow through the chin guard. Overall the construction quality, comfort and fit of the helmet is excellent. The aerodynamics are so good that I'm no longer looking for an upgraded windscreen.\n",

When you close all the vents it's almost like rolling up a car window as far as noise reduction.With most other brands I wear XXL helmet, with Shoei I can wear an XL since it fits my head better. When I first put the helmet on I felt like the cheek pads were too tight and was about to order the 31mm replacements, but after a couple of rides they're already feeling much better, so I suspect after a couple more the helmet will fit perfect.\n",

      "I wanted a helmet that was chock full of features, that had a built in sun visor, that reduced noise while riding, had pockets for speakers and bore the name of a reputable manufacturer.After carefully reviewing the specifications of the helmet, checking out the size and shape, I submitted an order to Revzilla whom promptly shipped out my high priced prize.When I received the helmet I unboxed it and pulled it over my head like a kid ready for candy on Halloween. I quickly discovered that the helmet was better shaped to my noggin, maybe a more fish bowl shape. The pressure that I had on my forehead was gone and the aches in my temples were no longer there.The alleviated symptoms may have been due to the variance in helmet sizing. In my previous model I wore an extra large. Since Shoei measurements were about the same I chose an extra large as well. It appears the Shoei brand runs a little on the large side. I used my Revzilla cash to purchase a thicker set of cheek pads (35mm). This improved the fit drastically although I could still have gone with the thickest millimeter offered (39mm).All the components fit snug and snap together as they should. A complete and rather quick teardown and reassembly shows off this solid bit of manufacturing.Quick notes on riding; the helmet is indeed quieter but not as quiet as I thought it would be. Also, if you ride a standard motorcycle like a dual sport the helmet does require a more downward angle in order to get maximum air flow.We adventure riders need to keep our heads up and our backs straight. I wish they made full faced helmets like the Shoei GT-Air geared towards riders of standard motorcycles with better air flow.The center pad plastic that connects at the front of the helmet came loose after a few rides. Snapping it back in place seems to have done the trick but I will be on the watch for any more loosenings.This is a great helmet and I would recommend it to anyone with money to BURN on quality.\n",

So far, so good.Comparisons: It really came down to the GT Air and the RF-1200 for me. The fit of each was almost the same on my head. The killer for the RF was the chin bar could touch my chin easily with the \"push test.\" The RF is so much lighter and easier to turn in, it was difficult to peel the sticker off the gt air and not be able to exchange it!Finish: I bought the matte black. I think it's the sexiest looking finish I've ever seen but it has it's drawbacks. It's a fingerprint magnet and if you drive through a sprinkler it leaves difficult-to-get-off spots. The interior feels nice and looks good, but I had a hard time finding any \"plushness\" difference between this helmet and an HJC. Arai helmets, on the other hand, are like putting ladies silk panties on your head, though (not that I've done it, but I imagine that's what they would feel like if I did).Fit: I tried on about 20 different helmets in medium and large at a bunch of local shops (I really wanted to buy local but the markups to give me 20% off for the 'sale' was just ridiculous). The larges were all too big for me. I have a 23\" head, so I'm right between medium and large in most sizing charts. I THOUGHT I had a long oval head until I put on an Arai Signet-Q. It had way too much air gap with my forehead. HJC large was the closest to fitting but they gave me a weird sore spot back further on the top of my head. Arai helmets all seemed to have zero space between my chin and the chin bar; when I did the \"push test\" on my chin bar, I could easily touch it to my chin. I don't want to break my jaw in a wreck, so Arai was out. I honestly wanted the Arai Defiant, but it just didn't fit.Riding: The first thing I realized pulling out of my driveway was that I'd forgotten my sunglasses again. Bam - I didn't need them! I laughed and remembered the built in sun visor. Honestly, it was great. It's pretty overcast in south Florida today so it was extremely effective. I'll find out in a day or two how it fares in *real* sun. It was extremely comfortable and didn't feel like it was being pulled around by the air at all. I could lane-check and not feel like I was getting pulled off the bike from my spaceball helmet.Ventilation: This is a true mixed bag. The chin vent is wicked effective at clearing the visor. Like... insanely good. I closed it and did some huffing & puffing, then opened. Clear almost instantly. The top vent doesn't do anything for me. I have long hair, so maybe I just can't feel it, but it seemed worthless. This was the biggest letdown of the helmet after reading countless reviews mentioning the \"mohawk of air.\"Sound: It's better than the helmet it replaces, but this was another letdown. I have a 10 year old HJC AC-11 (I know, I know) that finally met it's end so I needed something new. I can easily tell the difference since this helmet actually fits and can't spin around on my head. BUT... It's not earth shatteringly different. I expected 10 years of advances, double sealed gaskets, a chin curtain, and tight-fitment to really make a huge difference and it didn't.Feel: I do want to note that this helmet feels so comfortable and fits so well that I immediately felt safer riding. It was quieter and way, way, WAY less wind buffeting.Weight: The exact same as my old helmet. Again, disappointing but this has a built-in visor so I'm fine with it.Conclusion: Overall, it's a good helmet. I haven't ridden long enough to talk about whether or not the comfort liner or cheekpads compress too much leaving it ill-fitting, but right now they're perfect. I can't say I LOVE the helmet, but it's pretty darn good. I'd recommend it if it fits, but I'd recommend you try the RF1200 first.\n",

      "Clearly one of the best helmets on the market.\n",
      "This helmet is very comfortable, has some great features, and is well worth its price.It still has some wind noise but the level is lower than most other helmets.Ventilation is adequate.The sun shield is one of its best features and is clearly better implemented on this helmet than most others.The only negative on this helmet is the same as on most Shoei helmets, it’s the Shoei sticker on the front. It does not remove easily, especially from a flat black helmet. Some may not mind this sticker, but I consider it a big advertising campaign that I don’t think should be on the front of a helmet at this price level. The one on the back is enough. Also for the sake of aesthetics, the bump out on the back of the helmet could be a little less pronounced, but I assume it helps with wind noise.That being said, don’t let those small issues stop you from buying what is probably one of the best helmets on the market. For myself I had to order one size larger than the measurements said I needed, but that probably has more to do with the shape of your head.\n",

      "Studied new Shoei helmets for several weeks & decided on the GT Air. Shoei reputation speaks for itself & this is my 3rd Shoei. I considered the Shoei modular but went with the GT Air since I'm used the full face style & was not sure whether I'd like a modular. I don't tour, but usually ride the highways for fun & don't stop very often. Have had some time to try it out & can tell the air flow is improved over previous helmets which were the RF 200/700/1000. Very Satisfied!\n",

I am city rider, that commutes to work and then does long rides on the weekend and twistys in the hill around my house.I am surprised buy the helmet not being Snell rated but my guess is because of the visor, which is my favorite feature other than the shape. I ride an unfaired motorcycle and some helmets buffet at high speeds but the GT air seems to cut the air a little more than my Aria Corsair. Great helmet. love the quality and the fit of Shoei.\n",

      "Switched from Icon airframe to the GT Air and what a difference\n",
      "I was looking for a better helmet and I definately found this with the GT air. Head measures 22 1/4 to 22 1/2 so I bought the meduim. It was much tighter than my medium Icon to the point I thought I may need to switch to smaller cheek pads. But thats not the case, after a couple ours on the bike, I love it. I just couldnt believe the difference in quality and sound over my icon airframe. It was more than I had hoped for. The flip down screen works great, I just wish it was about a 1/4 inch lower but that is such a minor nit pick. It does fog fairly easily but I have not installed the pin lock or the breath guard yet and if I keep my visor open 1 click it helps keep the fog down alot.\n",

      "Worth the expense\n",
      "This is an upgrade to a Shoei Qwest. I was looking for a new one since I hit my head during a crash, and the Qwest held up perfectly.The internal sun visor was a huge plus for me. Negates the need for sunglasses, a big help for me since I wear prescription glasses. The foam padding is designed to work with glasses, another plus.On my Qwest, I had installed a pinlock visor and clear shield, and it made a huge improvement to the fogging properties. This comes with the visor/shield, so that's already money saved.This is quieter than the Qwest, but not by much. I still need earplugs at freeway speeds, or for longer rides. Can't say much about venting, since I had all of the vents closed because it was so cold.The nose guard keeps popping out - makes me want to glue it in place. Other than that, fit and finish are excellent. The little bottle of silicone oil was a nice touch.Overall, while it's an expensive purchase, I don't regret it at all. I felt it was a worthwhile buy.\n",

      "Definitely the most comfortable helmet I have owned. With softer fabric and foam my head feels like it is in a pillow. A couple helmets I still have around are a size large KBC VR2 and a size large Nolan N43. I also found the size large to be the best fit in the GT Air but it does feel slightly more narrow. The Pinlock insert on the N43 seems to work far better. I just can't seem to position the one for the GT Air in a spot that won't leak moisture through the bottom seal despite the breath guard also being in place. The chin curtain works well enough that I have been able to avoid wearing a balaclava. Ventilation is noticeably better than the N43 and I have worn that one through hundreds of miles of 100+ temps in NorCal so I'm sure this will be just as good or better. A very small issue was that the logo/sticker on the back of the helmet were off center. A big surprise for a manufacturer known for excellent finish, but not worth the expense of returning.\n",

      "I bought this as my first helmet 3 months ago, so I do not have much to compare it to. I do however use it every day to commute to work and have worn it throughout the winter and now into the spring and a few warmer days in the 70's.It has been extremely comfortable after breaking it in. I bought a small since I tried on an RF1100 and the small fit perfectly. When I received the GT-Air, it definitely felt smaller and hurt my ears for a few weeks. After breaking it in, the helmet has not given me any more problems regarding fit.Riding in winter temperatures is tolerable but I could not direct the wind off my chin and lips. After using a balaclava, this problem was resolved.The vents are nice but sometimes I cannot tell a difference with them opened or closed. They are very easy to use with gloves so no problem there.I bought the matt black color and love it, however it scratches easily and shows up white.The tinted sun visor is a very important feature for me since I commute back home into the sun and I have not had to squint yet. It has been great and very easy to use.Overall, I am VERY happy with the GT-Air and would recommend it to everyone I know.\n",

      "Very nice!\n",
      "I made the move from an open-faced helmet to the full closure with this helmet and I love it. Incredibly comfortable, exceptionally quiet, and a very good field of vision.The only drawback I have yet to experience is the aerodynamics at speed. I ride cruisers, so I am not into my hobby for speed. Thus, I turn my head quite a lot to see the sights. At speed, the aerodynamics of this helmet, which are fantastic for straight-line airflow, catch the wind if the head is turned to the side. Unless you are ready for it, it can actually grab your head a bit and throw you off. To be honest, this is not something I am worried about, but if you don't want the wind catching your head, search for a more rounded helmet.The incorporated sun visor is superb. Living in the Swiss sun, which is very intense - even in cold weather, an enclosed helmet can heat up. Just as soon as I drop the sun visor, the interior temperature drops considerably. Very nice!I have installed our comms unit - very easy to do on this helmet - and the ability to hear and speak is fantastic in this quiet helmet.I ride regularly for both commuting and pleasure. This helmet is easy to get in and out of, even though it is a little large.I ordered my normal size (7 3/8), and had to return it for the next size up. My Shoei open-face helmet fits perfectly and is true to size. This GT-Air fits at least one size smaller, so order up!I have not used the helmet in the summer temps, so I am looking forward to testing the airflow. Keeping my fingers crossed for the best, as I love to tour the American Southwest in spring and fall.\n",

      "4 month review\n",
      "Let's see...Size is bulky, your shadow looks like Charlie Brown (this is to be expected, what with the internal sunshield and all).I've never tried on other Shoei helmets so I cannot comment on whether the headshape is the same as other Shoei helmets, and since \"intermediate oval\" is subjective I cannot comfortably say that my head (which fits this helmet perfectly) is an \"intermediate oval\". So just know this: if your head shape is like mine, you will be fine *Nods*.By using the sizing guide, you will find that the helmet is uncomfortably tight when new. Trying to get it on was almost like someone reversed a video of giving birth. But after wearing it for a while, it breaks in and becomes snug, comfortably hugging your head (as it should).Vision is great as long as you are not tucked. Your peripheral isn't impaired at all, though the helmet's horizon does get in the way if you start tucking in, even if you are just a bit past the 3/4ths riding position.If you wear glasses like me, there are handy grooves in which you can slide your glasses into. However, your glasses will still fog. I've found that by removing the chin curtain you can reduce the fogging somewhat (though this increases noise). Removal of the chin curtain also allows you to stick a bendy straw up there for you to breathe through. In hot weather, you can also use the straw to cool down your sweet chest hair.If you leave the visor in the cracked position (closed but not clicked in) there will be a whistle when you're riding. This disappears when you click the visor down to secure the gasket.The internal sunshield is great. The slide to flip it down/up is smooth. However, it does seem to turn smudgy when you flip it up and then back down. Perhaps whatever is up in the slot where the sunshield goes is directly rubbing the sunshield. This isn't a large issue, as you can use a microfiber cloth for glasses and clean it. Distortion is minimal, if any at all.Noise... I have nothing to compare this helmet too, so I can't say. Seems fine to me, dampens noises well in the city. Just the other day, a tourist named Steve asked me for directions and I asked him to repeat himself four or five times cause I couldn't understand what he was saying with my helmet on. When I finally got the question and responded, he couldn't hear what I was saying and in the end just became frustrated and drove off. So screw you, Steve. On the freeway, you should probably wear earplugs to save your hearing if you want to hear your grandchildren's voices.Wind seems to flow right around this helmet when you are facing forward, but you definitely feel the wind during headchecks. However, I have an almost negative amount of muscle, so that's probably just me.Venting is noticeable, but more so if you're bald. I gave myself a number 1 haircut (stupidest idea of my life since it was during winter) and had to keep the top vent closed cause I got too cold. Now that my hair has grown back, I don't notice the effect of the top vents as much (top vents also have different adjustability with how open they are, though I don't notice a difference there). Chin/mouth vent is great. Unfortunately, if you overheat like me, these vents won't be enough and you will need to crack your visor open.Ending thoughts:- get this helmet if you are commuting on a bike that allows you to sit 3/4ths to upright- my fingers are tired- there are probably cheaper alternatives if you are broke\n",

      "Good in most respects but terrible whistle makes it unusable.\n",
      "Great fit, very comfy but firmly held, strap great, internal sun-shield great although the little lever is a bit fiddly and not the best solution I've owned, (disregarding for a moment the whistle) the noise level is fairly low, the ventilation is okay but not amazing as some have claimed, the visor even with pinlock in place will still fog up under 2 degrees (C) but is fine above that temp, visor adjustment is okay but the lowest open setting is impossible to use - easy to be closed and easy to get into second open position but impossible to get it into the first open position.However, there is a hideous high-pitched whistle which screams at any speed above 30mph. I have custom molded earplugs formed to the exact shape of my aural canal with music playing and yet the WHISTLE is incredibly audible and annoying. The helmet cost only a bit under £500 in the UK which is apparently $800 and I am close to ritualistically burning it and you tubing it and launching a twitter campaign against Shoei - they can sue me for everything I'm worth if they like, I'm not worth much!There is nothing worse than paying top dollar for a premium product to find that it is fundamentally flawed. The retailer in the UK just give me rubbish about them never having had any other complaints so I show them forums filled with people discussing 'The Renowned 2013 GT-Air Whistle' as it has become known and they just shrug and say 'I tried one mate and no whistle'. I have contacted Shoei's HQ in Europe and am waiting to see if they can fix it, but am so disillusioned about the purported high quality of this brand. After finding so many reports of the same issue and concluding that it is a design flaw which will likely never be fixed, I suspect that I will just have to write-off the roughly £500 ($800) and put it down to my own stupid naivete trusting a retailer's advice.AVOID this lid, unless maybe you are deaf and are hoping that a wild screaming howl of a whistle might bring back the gift.Oh, and just to be clear: I did not buy this helmet from Revzilla - I have bought things from them before and was very happy and reports on forums about their returns service is excellent and I suspect I would have been far better off buying this helmet from them as I suspect they would have treated me far better than the high-street retailer bought it from. I bought this from a local retailer in the UK as I was nervous about the fit, but to be honest the size I bought is exactly what I would have bought going by the fitting guide, so am feeling very silly about that. I am putting this review on Revzilla because it is the site I ALWAYS consult when buying kit, their reviews are incredibly detailed, so I felt honor-bound to contribute, having found such a terrible flaw with this particular product.\n"

It looks great. My first helmet was a big and bulky. The GT- air has made me love riding so much more. It is so much quieter on the road. I ride with other louder sport bikes and they don't seem as loud any more. how the windscreen seats itself into the gasket helps the wind noise so dramatically. The GT- air has great airflow. You can really feel a Mohawk of air on your head. My absolute favorite thing about this helmet beside the smooth sun visor, is the no-fog liner. It seems to be the same as what the Motorcycle police use to keep their helmets from fogging up. It works every time without fail. I've tested this by exhaling very quickly to try to fog it up but it just wont. There is nothing to complain about with this amazing helmet.\n",

      "I wanted to wait until I had ridden plenty of miles in this helmet before I made a review. I have had this helmet for about 3 months. I have ridden with it in city traffic as well as on long rides though the canyons. It has become my go to lid, and my x-11 has been bumped to track days.My last helmet is a Shoei X-11 that I still use. I was concerned it would be not as much of a long oval like my X-11 or Arai Signet Q that I am comfortable wearing. When the helmet arrived the helmet was a little tight, but my concerns were alleviated after a few days wearing the helmet on my 30 minute commute. Since then it has loosened up a little and has broken in wonderfully. I wear a large on my Shoei X-11 and a medium in Arai. The large was the right choice for me and the helmet profile is a good fit for my head.The liner is comfortable against my skin, and I would say that it is a step up from my X-11 in the form of comfort and wicking away sweat. The liner does like to grab on to Velcro. I find this annoying because my winter jacket has a Velcro collar. The Velcro in the collar likes to grab onto the chin strap while I am trying to turn my head to look over my shoulder. Maybe this is more the jackets problem...The quality is everything you would expect from Shoei. I bought the anthracite color and the finish is excellent with no orange peel or swirl marks. The helmet visor has a positive engagement from shut and open. I feel like the visor makes a much smoother transition from open to close compared to the x-11. And that brings me to the pinlock visor. I like this option, and it works really well. While ridding the pinlock cover on the visor remains clear of any condensation or fog. If you ride a lot, you need a pinlock visor.I love the flip down sun visor. It works great, and I don’t think I will ever buy another helmet without one. I find the tint of the flip down visor to be spot on, though some may want it a little darker. I rode for about 30 minutes into the setting sun and felt little discomfort from the brightness.I find the vents to be a little wonky, but they are big, easy to find, and easy to operate. Venting has been great, but I have yet to really test out the vents as it is cold right now. This summer will be the true test of the vents. The helmet comes with a removable chin curtain. I felt it was annoying against my beard, so I took it off and have not had it on since.I am glad I bought this helmet and would recommend it to anyone looking for a helmet with a flip down visor and good airflow.\n",

      "1st Helmet but a highly thought out purchase well worth the money!\n",
      "I spent a lot of time doing research on my first helmet because I have been waiting several decades to start riding and the same amount of time filling my head with useful nonsense so I wanted the best possible protection and comfort so I wouldn't have an excuse to talk myself out of wearing the helmet. When I first used this helmet it was still fairly hot outside in Chicago and the airflow, which was a top concern for me, was great. I don't sweat a lot but it was overall very comfortable in the heat. Since then I have ridden in temps as low as 30 degrees and the helmet, with vents closed, is just as comfortable in the cold. The pin lock fog shield that comes with the helmet has done an amazing job considering that your hot breath in a helmet when it's 30 degrees outside can steam things up a lot. I bought the plain white after a lot of research on the most visible colors and I can tell you that it has saved my life a few times already because you can't miss it even if you don't see me and the bike. The built in sun shield is what sold me the most even though this helmet is not Snell rated. The last thing you want to do when riding is to have to pull over to put on sunglasses? You just flip the switch on the side and you're all set. Unexpected sun popping out between buildings is no issue. Overall, if you're debating it, I'd say don't. It's really a fine piece of work and has a lot of great features. I don't regret dropping the extra money on it for a first helmet. I don't make major purchases without thinking about them a 100 different ways and I'm glad in this case I took the time to look around. I wear an XL and have a pretty round head and this is a perfect fit for me, but it seems like it might work well for many head shapes. It is extremely comfortable.\n",

I realize this is a little different than most reviews, but I just don't think the noise level matches the price. I ride a 2009 KLR with a Zero Gravity Sport Touring. I do think the windscreen adds to the noise level as it places the wind near my head due to my height, so don't want to beat it up too much. It may be great with other bikes. Has a whistle when I raise my head too much or turn to either side. Really the most irritating complaint I have. Called Shoei and need to send the helmet back for them to check it out. Just irritating and have been dealing with it so far with earplugs. This is a little negative but wanted to pass as best I can. Overall it is really comfortable, happy with the sun visor and field of view. Was bouncing between Medium & Large; glad I chose large.\n",

      "I rode down to the Philly shop to try out / compare helmets all at once, which I think is the best approach to critical equipment. The wiley veteran that helped me was super great with information and suggestions. Huge value there for Rzilla.I have the Qwest in addition to this helmet. The profile of the Quest is bigger and rounder than the GT Air, and therefore catches the wind/airflow more. The GT Air is more aerodynamic.I love the integral visor on the GT Air; it has never fogged up on me after about 20 rides in cool to cold weather. Easy to operate while riding.The face shield REALLY locks down; you have to give a hard squeeze between the finger tab and the underside of the chin guard to fully close it. That said, I generally leave it in the slightly cracked position to improve ventilation. I use this helmet with the pin-lock inner shield which does reduce (but not eliminate) fogging in all conditions.This helmet fits a little tighter that the Qwest, but is generally very comfortable and my head stays cool with the 3 vents.Remember that you are sacrificing Snell approval to get the integral sun visor; a trade-off that was worth it to me. You may feel differently.\n",

      "It's definitely not a cheap helmet, but it flows air great and has that amazing Shoei fit/quality. I hate wearing sunglasses under the helmet since they often cause temple pressure on long rides, so having a built in sunshade is awesome. This is probably the nicest one I've used. Very quiet helmet. The button on the chip strap is kind of a PIA to get with gloves on, but other than that it's hard to find a fault with these helmets (beyond price).On the style front sometimes Shoei will sell last year's graphics for a big discount. Not so much with the GT-AIR. I went with plain white and will sticker it up as required. It's not particularly stylish, but it's also less expensive and stands out more to motorists on the road.\n",

      "My favorite thing about this helmet is the built in sun visor. I never think about wearing sunglasses now. The visor has perfect optics as far as I can tell, is plenty dark even in direct sun, and is really easy to use. There is plenty of airflow through the top vent, which has two positions so you can limit air on a cool day.The helmet is a good fit and really comfortable. I usually wear a Medium in Shoei which is a bit snug. I went with the Large this time as the med was just too tight and it fits great.My only complaint about this helmet is that my eye glasses fog up more than with other helmets, not sure if has something to do with the front venting or something else. I've been leaving the pinlock installed, so no problems with the faceplate fogging.Overall a great helmet and I would definitely recommend it.\n",

      "The GT-Air is the best helmet I ever owned, so far: I have only had the helmet for a month. The helmet fits exceptionally well, but keep in mind my head is a bit longer front to back than average. Although the check pads gave that pinched effect at first, they have broken in quite nicely. I didn't notice any difference between the GT-Air and Shoei RF-1000 (old helmet I replaced) in terms of air flow and weight, but the internal sun visor makes the extra investment worthwhile when compare to the RF-1100 which was my other choice. All the air vents seem well made and sturdy and both visors offer no distortion. The shell design is leaps ahead of others I had in terms of buffeting. I have not experience any. Same bike, different helmet so I am attributing that to the shell design. Great helmet overall.\n",

      "I commute on my bike, and there is a stretch of heavily trafficked highway that is pretty much due east and straight into the sun in the morning. Over the years, I've learned the exact angle to hold my head so that I'm not blinded, but it restricts my view to the left. No more. Flip down the visor and done. Just outstanding design. Other pluses are the visor fit, and the anti-fog system that (so far?) is working great.On the minus side, the XXL helmet is hard to get over my ears, but once on fits well. The chin strap is also a bit close to the neck with a hard-to-reach snap. Otherwise, standard Shoei quality.\n",

      "Nice helmet- not sure it's worth the price, though.\n",
      "First off, this is my first Shoei helmet. I came from a Scorpion EXO-750 that served me well for some time, but was ready to be replaced. I made the mistake of trying on this helmet before anything else, and then spent the next month trying to talk myself out of such an expensive helmet and trying to find something anywhere as close to as comfortable and good looking (I have the white wanderer). The reviews seemed to say this helmet was great. Webbikeworld made it sound like the second coming of Jesus. Everywhere I looked it was a slam dunk. So I plunked down the money for the Wanderer graphics model and hopped on the bike. Immediately I was disappointed at how loud it was even with the vents closed. Maybe my old EXO-750 was just ahead of it's time or the reviews had me expecting more, but I expected a significantly quieter helmet. Other than that- I think it's a pretty sweet helmet. I find the brow and chin vents work really well (in an upright riding position, anyway), the visor detents are very \"clickable\" if that makes sense, and the sun visor is fantastic. It's been noted in other reviews that the sun visor fogs easily- and it does. The pinlock works real well and I leave it in even at night- it causes some ghosting of headlights but I don't think it's too distracting. it's also a very comfortable helmet if you have the right head shape.So overall, I think this is a really well built, quality helmet that looks awesome and will last a long time, but I honestly don't know if it's $300 better than, say, the EXO-1100. I'm happy I have it, but if I had to do it again I'd save the money and use it on something else.\n",

My commute includes about 20 minutes of highway speed.Airflow is very noticeable with top vents open. I have not worn it in very hot temps yet. I don't feel any air moving from front chin vent due to wind screen. I leave rear exhaust vent open in cold weather to help pull air through chin vent to help with fogging.The only fogging I get is to my glasses. The pin lock does its job just like on my other pin lock equipped helmets and the visor remains clear. On cold mornings I have to leave the visor up one notch to keep my glasses from fogging at slower than highway speeds. Once my speed increases, the rear vent pulls enough to stop my fogging issue.The internal sunscreen works as advertised. This is my second helmet with this feature and is now a must-have for any future helmets.I have a Shoei head and I have always worn a size large. The sizing on this one is no different.Finish is excellent and all moving parts feel crisp and precise. I have not worn in rain yet to test the double seal around the visor.\n",

The visor I love and there is room for prescription glasses.If you have a Cardo like I do . . . good luck. Still trying to fit the sucker in the helmet. Someday, the helmet world will catch up with internal blue tooth that really works.I love the field of view compared to the multitec plus it comes with the pinlock system that does come in handy.With the shield down at a stop your glasses fog up particular for me in a costal environment.\n",

      "I like the premium feel of the design, materials, and execution. The built-in sun shield feels solid, not like the cheap Chinese helmets. It is not particularly dark so when I ride into the sun I put on my sunglasses, which fit fine behind the lowered sun shield.I installed the pinlock system and ride with it all the time but I noticed that at night in traffic it creates a bit of glare. I know it is not supposed to be used at night and if I were out for a night ride I'd remove it.The helmet fits my head shape but I'm right in between Shoei sizes so I opted for the L (I've tried the M at a dealer and it does feel too small - not just tight but also short). L doesn't fit loosely, it just feels big on my head. And the helmet's not as quiet as I was expecting (I came from an old 3/4 helmet before it, so I was expecting a great improvement). For a ride longer than 10-15 minutes (at highway speeds) I have to put in earplugs.I can only feel air flow from the top vent. The chin vent and the back vent don't seem to make any difference. The chin vent maybe behind my wind screen, but the top rear vent makes no difference. After 3,000 miles I still cannot tell if it's open or closed.For my touring and adventure-riding purposes I wish I had invested a bit more and gone with the modular Neotec.\n",

Getting a pin lock visor with the helmet is a nice touch. I do fog up the sun visor though, so it's not 100% fog free.One thing I did notice is the increase in wind noise with this helmet vs. my 2 year old Qwest. The vents and visor stick up a bit more on this helmet which is probably the culprit. I wear ear plugs most the time, so not a big deal for me, but may be for some.\n",

I live in Los Angeles though and it's summer so it's been pretty hot.my original thought for helmet choice was the RF1100. I decided to spend a little more so I didn't have to carry sunglasses with me. I like the sun visor thing that pops down. The bad part is that because of this visor, you lose the snell safety rating. it was an okay compromise for me.the cheek pads were definitely tight for me in the beginning. I've noticed that as time has gone on they've gotten better. wearing them in. i know you can buy replacements of different sizes. i waited and i think it paid off. we'll see.i haven't used other helmets to compare, so i don't know how to compare noise. I bought some bluetooth headset thing so i removed the ear pads to put the speakers in. when i'm going highway speeds it's pretty loud in there. i should buy ear plugs.but i haven't noticed any sort of neck or head strain even after an hour+ of riding. pretty comfortable.\n",

I live in the Northwest and have to deal with rain and sun,, and most likely both during any ride and this helmet meets both very nicely. I've been stuck in traffic during heavy thunder showers with no fogging up and that was promptly followed by sun breaks and intense glare - both are handled very well.If there is anything to gripe about it is the D-ring strap.

I do have some issue with the pinlock shifting when I raise the visor and opening the airspace to moisture. It is easily fixed by reseating the pinlock before closing the visor. The chin vent doesn't seem to clear the visor, but that is probably due to the height of my windshield.I added a bluetooth headset to it, and most people don't realize that I'm riding if I talk on it so noise is not bad.The cheek pads were a little tight on me.

The only area that was really tight to begin with were the cheek pads, but after about a month of commuting, they broke in and I forgot all about them.The flip down sun visor works great as long as you're moving. It's the first thing to fog up when sitting at a traffic light. The pin lock visor is worth installing as it makes your clear visor virtually fog proof in normal riding. I wore it around the house and breathed into it as much as I could, and not a hint of fogging.Overall this helmet is a great step up from the RF-1000, no more switching visors during the odd commute hours. It's also a bit quieter, but it could just be the tighter fit as my old RF-1000 was worn and getting loose. Can't really go wrong with the GT AIR!\n",

      "After a good amount of consideration and backlash from some friends, I finally jumped into the world of motorcycles..... and man, am I enjoying it. After careful consideration, I was debating about the Shoei Qwest helmet but found myself appealed to the GT Air.First off, I have never tried any other motorcycle helmet before, with exception of MSF course (then again those worn out). The fitment was a bit tight when I first tried it on- I thought it was very constricting but didn't know any better. Now after riding for about a 10 days, the helmet feels awesome. It takes time for the padding to mold around your face and head. Now, in Northern California we experience what is called an Indian Summer, so the warm days are starting; I imagined it would be too hot to wear this helmet but ventilation is cool and love the sunshade- this alone is worth getting. I don't think I would ever choose another helmet unless Shoei develops one with the same features but is lighter (in my view, it is already light).I would recommend this helmet to any rider out there, the styling is great, and have been loving it more every day.Glad I read people's reviews and went this my first instinct.

      "This helmet is great. It has all the features I want in a helmet. It's light, the balance is good, maybe a touch heavy towards the front, the fit is good, tight at first but after about two weeks it has broke in and fits good now.The internal sun visor works well, just the right tint and the operation is smooth and precise, easy to operated with gloves on.The air flow is better then I thought it would be. I ride a GL 1500 and even behind the wind screen my head does not sweat, hot 95+ days and still good. You do get some wind noise from the venting, not too bad but it's there.The paint job is very nice and has no imperfections, and all the vents operate smoothly.The helmet is tight to get on and off though, hopefully this will get better over time with some more break in.\n",

      "Excellent helmet, interesting experience with sizing over the internet. I tried on a Shoei helmet my brother owns, must be at least 6-8 yrs old. Medium fit my head perfectly. Can't remember off-hand what model helmet this was. So I ordered a medium GT-Air. Did not fit whatsoever - no chance. Had an excellent experience exchanging the helmet with Revzilla. No complaints there at all. Received the large version of the GT-Air, which turns out to be a tight fit. Honestly a little too tight, but I'm hoping the pads wear in a bit. Better than too loose in the end. How and why, and if, the Shoei sizing has changed over the years, I have no idea. But overall, feature-wise, this is an amazing helmet. lightweight and sun visor included. Just wish I could have tried the sizes on in person - maybe I don't have a Shoei shape head. It's possible.\n",

      "Typical Shoei quality\n",
      "Upgraded from an RF1000 which I really liked and would have probably just kept using it if the headliner was replaceable. I did a good bit of research on all helmets that would work for sport-touring and settled on Shoei again. I already know their quality, and the completely removable and replaceable liner along with the pinlock, double visor seal, retractable sunshade and improved air flow made my decision pretty easy.I've only had the time to ride once with the GT Air and I'm happy with the results, the airflow is definitely improved and cools well when moving in the hot & humid Florida weather. Quite a bit quieter, wind noise is greatly reduced while at the same time still being able to hear the exhaust note very cleanly.My old RF1000 fit perfectly in size Large, the Gt Air is just a touch snug in the same size, but still feels good and I'm sure It'll break in after I get a few more rides in. There are different size cheek pads available, so I have that option if need be.I haven't used the pinlock shield yet, with the chin curtain installed I did experience some minor fogging of either my sunglasses or the sun shade when stopped (with visor closed. The visor itself stayed fog free and when leaving the visor just slightly cracked open, the fogging issue was eliminated. It does take a bit of getting used to where the sunshade ends and leaves a clear gap that makes me think I left the visor partially open (probably because I used a dark tint shield on my RF).I experienced no buffeting, even deep into triple digit speeds, and no problems with turning to the side at speed, which was a severe issue with the RF1000.There are only two things that I would change if I could...the GT Air is slightly heavier than the RF1000, obviously it has more features so this is not unexpected, but it will take a few rides to get used to the additional weight on longer rides.The visor is currently only available in clear, with tinted pinlock shields available. I would rather have the option of a tinted visor to use with the clear pinlock shield. Its just a personal preference on the aesthetics, but one I'd like to have the choice of..Obviously these are minor issues, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. If you are in the market for a quality helmet, geared toward longer rides, you should give this one some serious consideration. (check out the X twelve for track/short rides)\n",

      "I did a lot of shopping & research before buying this helmet. I wanted a good quality helmet that was protective, fit well, and had an internal sun visor.After several weeks of use, I'm very happy with the GT Air. It's well-made and looks good, too.The internal sun visor is fantastic, eliminating the need for sunglasses. Just flick a lever and the visor is down or up, easy as that.My only complaint is that the padding cutaway for the strap creates a gap that allows a loud channel of wind into the helmet right under the ear. (I have a scrawny neck, so maybe that makes it worse.) Anyway, to quiet things down I tuck a piece of foam into the gap on each side after the helmet is strapped on. While this takes care of the issue, obviously, I’d rather not have to do this workaround.Other than that one point, I like this helmet very much and would recommend it.Pros:Good quality materials and finishSnug, secure fitWide field of visionInternal sun shield!Pinlock shield includedConsSomewhat difficult to get on/offLoud, due to strap cutaway allowing too much wind inside\n",

      "This is my 3rd Shoei (TZ-R, RF-1000, and GT-AIR), and it was a tough decision to spend this much money on a helmet; but I'm very happy with the result.The fit is very similar to the RF-1000 which its replacing, and a lot more comfortable.This thing is QUIET. So much quieter than my previous two helmets its hard to believe. The internal sunshade is more than just convenient, its a game changer.The air vents are still a bit of a mystery to me. It doesn't feel like there's a whole lot of air moving thru the helmet despite the name, but it doesn't really get stuffy or hot. I assume its the air IS moving thru, but is not directed at me to be blasted n the face/head. The front vent works great, directing the air onto the visor, and not your face. Make no mistake you wont think your riding with the wind in your face with this helmet, unless you leave the visor open.Then the pinlock system is a nice touch, but wearing it at night is disclaimed as a no-no, do it anyway and youll find that it doesnt affect your vision so much with a light tint like the warning states, as it is a distortion effect causing you to see tripple (bright points such as headlights and taillights along the road).Another drawback is the way the visor is pulled back to the helmet when closing. Great idea for sealing out the elements, but that thing means business. Everytime I close the visor its like getting hit with a hammer as it snaps shut with incredible force.These minor drawbacks will be more than easy enough for me to live with, I love the fit, style, comfort and convenience of this helmet, and would definitely recommend it to others.The little design updates since the RF-1000 really make this helmet shine.Relocated visor tabInternal sunshadeTighter neck rollEmergency release tabsAnd THE QUIET.\n",

      "I've been using it for ~2 weeks now, both daily commute + one longer weekend ride. (~500 miles).Overall I'm very pleased with the helmet, it feels good, sun visor is a saver, great ventilation. On the highway helmet is not as quiet as I expected it to be - but I think that most of the wind noise is from the bike and not the helmet. If I stand on the bike noise level drops dramatically, even though I'm high above the windshield.The helmet felt quite tight at the beginning, mostly pressure on the ears - it's getting better over time.

Pinlock system is awesome. Absolutely zero fog. Helmet size is tight, but hugs your neck great. No need to wear a balaclava. Very quiet. The helmet will whistle if you have the shield cracked in city mode. Nothing you can do about it just how the wind hits the face shield. Highly recommend this helmet. For a 500$ price point, I think it's a great investment if you value having a higher quality helmet.\n",

      "I have wanted to purchase this helmet for sometime now. I was pleased as could be upon its arrival. The fit is a bit snug for me in the cheeks, and a tad loose at the very top of my head, but I had tried on several different sizes at various stores over the previous couple of months and the XXL was the best fit I could find. I wish Shoei had a bit better selection for the replacement liners in this size, but it fits as well as I find given the overall design.This helmet is pleasingly quiet. Light on the head, and very stable at freeway speeds. I live in the very hot desert of Southern Nevada and temps in excess of 115 can be expected on the pavement so I need a helmet that breathes easy and this one doesn't disappoint! It is not air conditioned and you know you a locked up in this thing, but crack the face shield and feel like you are nearly riding without it.The last comment I would give is the wide range of visibility. My everyday helmet is a 3/4 and I wear goggles. This provides better vision by far over the goggles. I would recommend this helmet just on the basis of that.\n",

      "I bought this helmet to supplement my Arai XD-3 which has a built in visor bill and works best for slower speed trail riding. I use the GT-Air for mostly highway riding and the aerodynamic profile is exactly what I was looking for. The ventilation qualities are a big disappointment vs. the Arai design. If you ride a lot in warm to hot climate zones, I wouldn't recommend this helmet. Comfort is good but only after a break-in period of about a dozen uses. What really surprised me was how much wind noise you get. I expected a big improvement over the Arai but it's no better. Ear plugs are still required for extended riding above 30 mph. The flip down sun visor is the best feature. I like not having to use a tinted shield which requires a swap out to clear for night use. Sizing was accurate.\n",

The visor mechanism works as advertised, very smooth in both directions. The visor is dark enough for almost all sunlight conditions with the exception of direct sundown-type light. The helmet is very comfortable for extended trips and is above average when doing high-speed lane checks. My only complaint is the snap-mechanism for the helmet strap is in a difficult-to-access position and usually requires several attempts to fasten. I am very satisfied with this product.\n",

I had heard internet rumblings that the Airs fit a bit smaller, but some said they were the same as the 1100. Turns out, the Air is definitely 1/2 size smaller than the 1100, as the 2XL Air was noticeably tighter.Worse, though, was the shape was subtly different. I noticed right away that it put uncomfortable pressure on my forehead, the famous \"Shoei head.\" There was also a bit more space on the sides of my head. The RF1100 in 2XL feels markedly different and fits me great.So, while the helmet overall seems excellent (as far as I can tell; I returned it without riding in it), please be aware that it is a bit smaller and more round than the RF1100.\n",

It touches the ears just a bit and can be annoying if you don't take the time to fiddle with it and get it just right before every ride.2. Again with the fit, the helmet fits snug on the sides but moves vertically a tiny bit. This might because of the elongated shape to accomodate the sun-visor.3. The sun-visor is OK. Not particularly great at blocking the sun and not very clear.4. The pin-lock insert scratches too easily. It says \"great care must be taken\" but even with great care all it takes is one slip when installing it.5. The eye-glass slot is terrible. It's the same as with my old Shoei Z-Two.

I rate the noise level as low. I find the helmet is quieter with a slight chin down position and at times I can get a coke bottle thrum from the chin vent that changes with chin angle. Ventilation is good with a good breeze across the top of the head and the chin vent provides good flow to the face. So far I’ve ridden into the mid 90s without a sweaty head. The pin lock works well except if moisture gets between it and the shield. Eye glasses fit with no issues. The sun shield isn’t as dark as my previous helmet. My head measurement was in-between a medium and large and on the recommendation of Revzilla I went with the medium. Helmet was very tight to begin with but now fits nicely.\n",

Of great value to me is the built in sun visor. I hate messing with sunglasses under a helmet, so this visor is perfect.

      "Good Helmet\n",
      "The fit is comfortable and the features are great. You get a chin skirt, breath guard, internal sun visor, and a Pin-lock system. Overall I think that warrants the higher price but only for the solid color versions. I think there is too much of a discrepancy in price between the solid and graphic versions.The air flow is excellent but that comes at a price with vent noise however the helmet over all is decent noise wise. The smaller opening around the neck seems to cut down on buffeting noises all together. The top vent is the noise maker if you are sitting in an upright riding position but it also flows the most air. If you tilt your head forward slightly the noise goes away but then so does the air flow as the helmet is designed for an upright position. The chin vent is quieter than the top vent and flows a nice amount of air along the visor and up to the forehead and I couldn't tell an air-flow difference with the exhaust settings but there also wasn't an increase in noise. If you close the vents the noise is much lower but I would still recommend ear plugs.I haven't tried the Pin-Lock system but without the Pin-lock installed you will fog up on certain days at a stand still even with the vents open and sometimes at low speeds if you have all the vents closed. You can crack open the visor to help some but that's probably why they include the Pin-lock system.Visibility seems decent but I can see the Pin-lock plugs at the edge of peripheral vision. If the sun-visor is down you don't notice them as much and the visor works pretty good. Smooth action sliding and comes down far enough but not too far to touch my face.With the chin curtain install I had a much harder time getting the helmet off since the opening is already smaller than most helmets. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to use my ear phones because when I am putting the helmet on my ears get folded and I have to wiggle the helmet a bit get them back in position. On the plus side they do have cutouts for speakers.I got the solid white version and the plastic used on the top vent does make it look a little cheap but other than that the helmet looks quality.Overall I would recommend the helmet because it is very stable in the open air from my naked Aprilia Shiver, it is comfortable, flows good air, and has an internal sun-visor.\n",

      "Had this helmet about a week now, got it at my honda dealer but thought id review it for yall anyway. Im comparing it to my previous lid, an exo 1000 I've been using the past 5 years. I did a lot of research before buying this helmet and had read a few harsh reviews. I bought this helmet mainly for it's reputation for being quiet, and it's just that. No creeking, whistling, and wind noise is minimal, it's like being in a car. The ventilation is unimpresive, as the front vent only vents to the shield and the top vent only gets the top of the head. Other reviews mentioned the ventilation being bad, but it's all part of the quoet design, as it is just as quiet with open vents as closed. The pinlock works well and is totally unobtrusive once in. It's my first pinlock and it goes on easy and I've found it to work just fine at night. Shoei put absolutely no anti fog on the visor, it fogs incredibly easy. You can be moving along in warm weather and it will fog without the pinlock in. I dont think they could have sold this helmet without the pinlock, it's a necessity not a bonus. This can also be attributed to the quiet, no air in or out design. The visor works far better than the one on the exo and is dark enough that people can't see through it. It cuts through wind a little better than the exo did. It fits snugly and is comfortable for long rides. I didn't rate durability high because the matte black finish has already got perminate scratches and scuffs. Just touching it give it a smudge that will remain until it's washed. It looked amazing and stealthy out of the box, but now looks like a kid with popcorn fingers has had his way with it. I doubt the finish will last past a year or two, it's bad, even as matte black goes. The exo had an industry leading anti fog visor, comfy removable lining, vented decently, a far more smudge free matte finish, and was sub $300. The only problem was it's deafening noise at speads over 55. The gt air is by no means twice as good a helmet, but it's ten times quieter, and thats what I wanted.\n",

      "Huge Improvements Over Previous Schoei Models\n",
      "I have had 2 Schoei helmets before this one. The reason I moved out of my last one is that I have an Autocom system with speakers that made the fit around the ears painful. It was a size large. It was a tight fit for my fat head. I had been looking casually for a new helmet for 2 years, actively searching for the last 2 months. I visited motorcycle dealers and tried many on. I learned in my search that a few features were must haves: the best ventilation possible, proper fitment for my fat head especially around the ears for speakers, a fixed full face style, and a built in sun visor. I searched what seemed endlessly online and offline, until I discovered Revzilla. The website helped me quickly narrow down the available choices given my criteria. The video reviews were over the top informative, and absolutely helped me nail down the exact model I wanted. I discovered from the video that there are recessed areas in the GT-Air for speakers!!! :) I've had the GT-Air out for several rides, in cool 60 degree weather, and in 78 degree sunny and muggy weather. (78 is hot for Wisconsin) It has lived up to my expectations in every way. Sitting still at a traffic light, the shield was down, and I didn't notice til I took off, that it had not fogged up. I highly recommend Revzilla and this product. I have had all white helmets, this one included. I guess the only thing I would change is that I would have liked a true high-viz yellow one in retrospect. I am uncertain whether the yellow one is high-viz, it looked a little dull online and there were conflicting Q&A answers as to whether it was high-viz, but, I am happy with the white.\n",

      "Overall very happy with this helmet!\n",
      "So far, I am very happy with this helmet. After looking at several models, I settled on the GT-Air because of the aerodynamics and the internal sun shield, even though the presence of the internal shield means the helmet will not have a SNELL ratting.So far, the fit and finish of this helmet has been really nice. The visor works really well and is crystal clear. Air flow on the helmet is amazing. With the vents full open, you can feel the air rushing through the helmet. With my old helmet I had awful wind buffeting issues on the highway. The GT-Air cuts right through the wind on the highway making for a very smooth ride.I do have a rather large head. I bought the XL which on the Shoei size charts puts me slightly larger than what I measured. The fit was still pretty tight. While the smaller opening at the bottom of the helmet cuts down on wind noise, it does make it a little harder to get the helmet on and off. The preformed ear cups for speaker placement is a bit limiting, and the cups aren't quite big enough for my ears. The cheek pads in this helmet also run very large. The helmet comes with a medium sized cheek pad, and it will cost you $50 more to get the larger or smaller size.Overall, I am enjoying the helmet and would recommend it!\n",

      "Great helmet. Nice upgrade from an HJC\n",
      "I ordered this helmet originally in small as I am equal to the measurement at the high end of small. No go. Returned for medium - perfect fit. The slider bars in the submit review form didn't work for me shape,vision etc so they are all default neutral so Ill speak to those categories. The vision is great. Love the flip down sun visor. Easy to use. Shape is good. Not too oval, not round either. Tons of compliments on the style of this helmet. It's quieter than my HJC. I would say it has a small fit and to go up if in doubt, even though some Shoei brand reviews say not to. This one feels snug and too small just heightens the snug feel. I got the red and love the shade. It's bright and hopefully well visible to drivers. I wasn't sure about going from a hundred and fifty dollar helmet to a five hundred plus helmet. My husband says \"if you have a five dollar head, you get a five dollar helmet\". I decided my heads worth five hundred to me. He only wears Shoei helmets and has crashed before. I was wearing a cheaper helmet and haven't - yet. I can't speak to the protection of one versus the other but I can say this feels like an excellent quality helmet. I can see now that the less expensive helmet had cheaper material than this one. Less padding. Knock on the outside of the helmet and i can hear the HJC has a plastic hollow sound. I hope I don't have to ever write a crash review but for a riding experience review I'm glad I shelled out the extra cash and got this helmet. I would recommend it to anyone based on my experience and the reputation of the Shoei brand for crash testing ratings.\n",

      "Thanks to the guys at Revzilla for their patience in helping me decide on this helmet over the phone. My former lid was a Shark RSX, which worked well for many years. I was concerned that my oval head would be best suited for a new Shark Speed-R Sauer. I liked that design too. But in the end, I opted for the Shoei GT-Air because of the safety features and sophisticated design. Truthfully, the Revzilla videos are an excellent source of information. Kudos to you guys for probably the best helmet video reference on the web. My wife chose the Red Shine for visibility and to compliment my Ducati. I like it too. Very red!The fit is comfortably snug on my head with no pressure points. My head measures a tad over 24\" and I normally wear XL. That's what I ordered. My glasses fit nicely inside and behind the very cool internal drop-down smoked visor. I was particularly impressed by how quiet the Shoei is compared to my RSX - even with the vents open. I also inserted the breathguard and cracked the visor when riding slower for better air circulation. Overall, I am very happy with this helmet and the way it fit so well right out of the box.\n",

      "I sold my Shoei Qwest to get this GT Air so I can have the integrated sun visor. Overall, this helmet is a literal move rather than a upgrade.What's great:The sun visor - no longer have to carry two shields around.QUIET! That's for sure. Much quieter than the Qwest.Aerodynamic - This thing does cut thru the wind. I feel about half the buffeting from the wind compare to my Qwest.Lighter - it feels that way but never measure the two side by side.Comes with pinlock visor.Not so great:Vents - as many others have said, the vent is ok. No where near the venting as the Qwest.Hot - the venting position in the visor is not nearly as venting as the Qwest. I find the helmet to be a bit hot.Fits a little snug - maybe I need to break it it more.Price - a bit pricy for the number of cons.If this was my first helmet, I'd prob think it's awesome. But compared the Qwest, it's only a slight upgrade with the quietness and sun visor.\n",

      "Good helmet - louder and provides less ventilation than expected\n",
      "I was looking for a new helmet to replace my aging Arai Profile and settled on the GT-Air after much research. The primary selling points were quietness and great ventilation. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed with both of those features as I'll explain below.I currently have about 2000 miles on the helmet with the majority of those miles stemming from my daily commute (about 75 miles of freeway travel).I initially found the helmet to fit slightly small and had difficulty putting the helmet on without hurting my ears. After a few days of riding, the helmet broke in nicely and now I find the fit very comfortable.The external visor and drop down sun visor are both fantastic and I love that a Pinlock shield was included as part of the package. I've found the Pinlock shield is absolutely necessary to prevent fogging in this helmet (and yes, I wear it at night too).The overall fit and finish are great, but the white helmet I purchased comes across a little too plastic like for my tastes (reminds me of a Fisher-Price toy). I was hoping for more of a painted white helmet like you might find on Arai models.As I mentioned at the top of this review, quietness was a major consideration in the purchase of this helmet. At slower speeds I found the helmet to be very quiet, but once I jumped on the freeway and traveled at higher speeds, I noticed significant wind noise coming from underneath the helmet. The noise was much more pronounced than my previous three helmets (all Arai). The noise was so loud in fact, I considered going back to my old helmet (and I do wear earplugs). I even changed the windscreen on my bike in an effort to redirect the air to see if it made any difference (negligible). Although I still find the noise loud, I've grown accustomed to it now. If you're a shorter rider and able to completely fit behind a windscreen, the helmet would probably be just fine in this regard. But if you're taller and always seem to be stuck in the jet stream, you might face my problem.I was also disappointed with the ventilation, primarily the lack of ventilation directly to the face through the chin bar. This really bothers me, as I feel like I'm suffocating especially on hotter days. In contrast, the top helmet ventilation is excellent and provides great air flow.Overall, I find the GT-Air to be a good helmet and would recommend it to someone if they found the areas I faulted unimportant.\n",

      "I love this helmet. It is a great fit. I looked at Shoei vs an Arai because of the sun visor. I was afraid it wouldn't fit, but the fit is excellent! As for the aerodynamics, it is the best helmet that I've purchased so far. I rode through wind advisory wind gusts in Arizona, and my head didn't bobble once. Even glancing back, I didn't feel like my head would rip off my shoulders.I have a dual sport helmet if I want a lot of air, so I didn't buy this helmet for increased air flow within the helmet. It is a little warm when stationary (cheeks get hot), but once I am moving - no problems. This is the first helmet where I can actually feel the air flow on the top of my head.I love the vent controls They are made for gloves - nice and big and easy.Lastly - it comes with the pin lock! Not only the shield, but the insert. I live in the PNW, so anti-fog is a must. This is my first pin lock visor, and I will never look back.\n",

      "Quiet, Comfortable, Stylish\n",
      "I have ridden with this helmet for approximately 1,000 miles now and I am thoroughly satisfied. I am most impressed with the aerodynamics of this helmet. I ride a naked bike with no windshield or flyscreen so my head is basically hanging out there with no wind protection whatsoever. Compared to my Shoei Multitec and other less premium helmets, the GT Air cuts through the wind blast like a hot knife through butter. On top of that the helmet is also incredibly quiet. I estimate it is at least 30% quieter than the Multitec. I believe this is a result of the excellent double gasket seal around the visor and the tight fit around the base of the helmet. Overall the helmet is very comfortable and after about 10 minutes with it on it feels as though it's a part of me and I'm not even wearing a helmet. Also, the fact that it comes with a pinlock insert and has an internal sun visor is just awesome.The styling of the GT Air is also superb. The aerodynamic shape does wonders for functionality as well as the looks. I have the red color and it is absolutely a head turner.I do have a few minor gripes with the GT Air though.There are currently no tinted visor options available for this model. While the internal visor is an awesome feature, I would still like to have the option of putting a tinted visor on the helmet (mostly for looks).The chin strap is slightly less comfortable than other Shoei helmets I have owned. Not bad though.I was misled by the fact that the model name had the word \"Air\" in it and assumed this helmet would vent really well. In my experience I feel practically no air coming through the top vent with or without the rear exhaust vent open. The front chin vent does an okay job but nothing more. I think \"Air\" in the name refers more to the aerodynamics of the helmet than air venting.The GT Air is only DOT certified, not Snell. This could be a deciding factor if you are looking to use this as a track day helmet.Overall, I really love this helmet and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, comfortable and stylish helmet with premium quality materials and construction. The price is certainly a bit high but when you're out on a long ride it is absolutely worth it for the great lasting comfort.\n",

      "I have an X-12, which I absolute love - it is great for the track. However, I wanted to get another helmet for street use. At first I tried cheaper helmets, and then went back to Shoei. After a lot of deliberating, it was between the GT Air and the RF1100. They are very similar helmet, but the GT Air:1. Fits slightly tighter - as you've probably seen from other reviews, the GT Air sizing is almost in-between the typical Shoei sizes. However, that's good for me - the RF1100 felt a little loose after wearing it for a bit, so the GT Air feels better.2. Has the built-in sun visor - this is a cool feature, because I don't need to change visors... I can ride with the clear one (yay night riding) and still block out the sun when I need to.3. Has a smaller chin bar \"height\" - with the RF1100, when I would look behind me, my chin would hit my shoulders and get in the way; with the GT Air, the chin clearance is higher, so it feels better to look behind me... this was a big deal for me.4. Feels slightly heavier - that's the only downside, the helmet feels just a tad heavier than the RF1100, which makes sense since it has the additional modular visor.Overall, this seems like an excellent choice for street riders. It has decent air flow (huge vent on the top), and is quieter than the X-12. I am pleased.\n",

      "I ride a sport bike and a cruiser and I commute - so I'm riding almost every day. I needed a helmet that did well in the tuck position with aerodynamics but vented well in the upright position as well. The other feature I need in all my gear is, less equipment to carry on the bike. Also, since I commute, I prefer a helmet with a fully removable washable liner.So I loved the features on this helmet especially the built in smoke sun shield (this is the shoei dark smoke by the way). That way I don't have to carry an extra shield somewhere.The pinlock defogging shield is also nice but I wear glasses and commute both during the day and at night so this is less useful for me (since you are not supposed to wear the pinlock insert at night). But it does help a lot with the shield not fogging up.The airflow is good. Not as good as the QWEST but still good.This helmet shines, in my opinion, with the aerodynamics. I have been riding with it in some pretty heavy Texas crosswinds and my head does not buffet around much at all. Same with head checks - no real buffeting. This is/was a problem with the QWEST.It is also quite light and really darn quiet. It's lighter and quieter than the QWEST.Fit - I like my helmets to fit more like a race fit (fairly tight). I wear a Small in the QWEST and a small in this one but this one does fit a bit more snugly than the QWEST does in the head shape department. The cheek area fits the same.Now comfort and safety - The lining is really really great. Very soft and comfortable. Much nicer than the QWEST lining. And I really think the emergency release cheek pads are a very nice touch and honestly another \"at the top of my list\" features that sold me.Please note: this is only DOT certified (right now at least). Just wanted to point that out even though Anthony mentions it in the video review and it is clear in the product details.\n",

Don't get me wrong, I love the helmet, it's just not what I expected. That being said, it is far more quiet than I would have anticipated and the design allows me to look over my shoulder at higher freeway speeds without having to tuck my chin, if you know what I mean.Everything is very easy to operate with thick Gerbings gloves, and the vents have a nice CLICK to let you know they've moved, which can be a challenge on some helmets.I've been riding with it for about a month so far, but have yet to even notice anything negative to say about it, other than the fact that it's a bazillion bucks... but you get what you pay for, and this will be worth it when it needs to be.\n",

After wearing the helmet for a few weeks now, I am happy with the fit/function of the helmet, but it isn't as quiet as I had hoped (tried with air vents open and closed) and the airflow isn't what I was expecting. I do like the padding, and my bluetooth fits well in the helmet. I was also bummed that this helmet didn't have some great exterior design patterns (yet), but a few stickers later, I love mine. The visor function works great, is easy to use with gloves, and provides good sun protection without impairing vision. I haven't tried the fog-free lens due to where I live (HI), so I can't speak to that. My only other gripe is I shave my head and the material on the crown of the head padding is abrasive on a bare skull, but I intend to wear a headwrap on long rides so hopefully that won't bother me as much.\n",

      "First of all this is my first Shoei helmet. I usually ride with a shorty helmet (HJC and Harley Davidson) I wanted a full faced helmet for the protection and when it rains so you can see better. The Shoei GT Air is much more snug when you first put it on compared to a helmet of less quality. The Revzilla staff do a great job explaining all of the fit issues. The helmet will break in and feel less snug, not loose, just less snug. It now is just right. I love the pin lock shield that comes with the helmet for anti fog purposes, that will come in handy down the road. I also like the fact that you can remove the cheek pads, and the whole lining system to wash or clean and dry out if or when it gets sweated up. Other cheaper models do not have that feature, after long trips the helmet starts to get smelly, I do not like that at all. I also installed a Sena SMH10-11 Bluetooth headset on my Shoei GT Air with the wired mic installed so you can hear your GPS or phone or even music while wearing your helmet. The stereo on my Harley is awesome, with this helmet on it is very quiet and the Sena SMH10-11 will work good if I do want to listen to music or take a phone call or hear direction on the GPS... The GT Air is very, very well made with every little detail is finished from the paint job on the helmet (awesome) to the fabric the lining is made from to the shield and vents... TOP QUALITY all the way. I am anxious to ride it the helmet, just need to get rid of more snow here. Real soon. The designs of the vents and the small scoop on the top front to catch air and channel it to the back to get sucked out by the venture created by the aerodynamics of the helmet itself should work great. Even the front chin area will administer air on the shield and up to help cool the head and face. I really am impressed with the helmet thus far...\n",

This is my second helmet in just over a year of riding; my first was a bell modular that is sorta bigger than this shoei full face. Give a day or so to get used to wearing a full face if you've never used one. It definitely gave me the chipmunk look!\n",

Not so with the GT-Air. The fit, finish and quality is excellent. It is light and at highway speeds it is extremely stable.

      "First of all, I would like to thank the Revzilla team for their excellent service. Quick shipping, well packed etc. This was my first order with Revzilla and most definitely won’t be my last.As for fit…I have an XR 1100 in small, so based on the review video, I ordered the same for the GT-Air. The fit runs true to size…the same as the XR 1100. A Snug fit, but not to extreme…Very comfortable.There is a lot of airflow in the chin vent area, even when closed…In the winter, it could be a little too much…Time will tell. With the vent open, I had a steady flow of air on the face shield…necessary for city driving so my eyeglasses wouldn’t fog up. I just closed it on the highway so no issues.My first impression of the helmet is wow…This is a quiet helmet.My XR 1100 is still loud in comparison, even with a whisper strip installed. At speed, (180 to 200 kmh) there was no buffeting…Head checks no problem, very stabile.I have only had a chance to test the helmet for about a two hour ride due to weather…I can’t wait to see how it is in summer time temperatures.The fit and finish is simply Shoei quality.I would definitely recommend this helmet to anyone in the market for a new one.\n",

      "This is my third Shoei helmet, have a TRZ and RF1100. I agree with the reviews of IRIDE247 and BRAVO21. At first I thought the fit was tight, but it broke in quickly, a little different fit than the RF1100, snug but very comfortable, no pessure points. I find it to be quieter than the 1100 but do get wind noise in the brow area, the padding around the ears is thicker and I believe that is why it is quiet overall. Ventilation is very good and the vents are easy to find and operate with gloves. Because of the tighter fit the helmet is warmer in the cold weather, <30 degrees, but the sunvisor does fog up in the lower temps when speeds are slower, at times it can be cleared by just opening the rear vent, and by just using the rear vent the enough heat stays in. But if it doesn't clear I have to constantly open and close the face shield a little, or don't use the sunvisor until the temp increases. Pinlock Anti-Fog works fine. The sunvisor is a good shade, not dark nor light, operates smoothly and side slide for the visor can be found easily and used quickly if necessary.Great RevZilla experience, I ordered an XXL first, but decided it was loose in the crown area. XL was fine. None of my local dealers had the new GT nor did they expect to get them in anytime in the near future, the exchange process was quick and easy.Shoei, are you reading this? I think anyone buying your helmets should be able to pick cheek pad thickness at the time of purchase, rather than having to buy them at some later time.I really like this helmet.\n",

      "I've been a Shoei guy since 1990 when I bought a X-9 helmet. About a decade later I purchased a X-11 and when the X-12 came out I was sure I'd grab the X-12 but the RF1100 worked better for me. The RF1100 is a fantastic helmet. After using the RF1100 for a couple of years I found the helmet met all of my needs but I wished it had some of the features that were starting to become standard on many helmets such as fog free or Pinlock visor and drop down sunglasses. I could have purchased a PInlock visor for the RF1100 but the cost of the Pinlock shied was so high that I decided to wait to upgrade the RF1100 when the time was right.Last spring the time seemed right when Neotec came out. I'm not a huge fan of a flip helmet but the Neotec fit my head better than the Shuberth and I took the plunge for the Neotec. I really like the Neotec for group rides where it is nice to flip the front and talk but on other trips and commuting I wanted a full face with the features of the Neotec.A couple of weeks ago I purchased the GT Air. Fit is just like the RF1100 and Neotec. Helmet feels light, style is beautiful to my eyes and all of the goodies seem to work very well. It will be a while before I get out on the road because we still have snow falling but wearing it around the house to break it in reveals this is an exceptionally comfortable helmet and very well made.For what it is worth I have tried a few of the less expensive offerings from Scorpion to see if their fog free coating worked and if I would be happy with a helmet at a lower price point. I was impressed with these helmets, especially for their price point. However, the fog free coating does go away in about 6 months to 1 1/2 years and you are back to a shield that fogs up. With a Pinlock the Pinlock does not lose the fog free properties. Also, while the quality of the Scorpion and other lower priced helmets is very good to excellent for the price point, they are not up to par with the Shoei's. If the budget is tighter I would not hesitate to look at some of the lower cost models. However, if you can stretch your funds a bit further, if you take long trips or if you ride where fogging is a common problem I would consider paying the extra for this Shoei. This helmet does it all and it is all integrated into one helmet. No stopping to change shields, no fogging, no fog free treatments. Just a quality helmet that looks, feels and works great.\n",

      "Great street helmet could use some refinement.\n",
      "To begin with I've had HJC, KBC, Arai and Shoei and used them for racing, touring, street, winter, summer you name it. I'd been looking specifically for a street helmet with built in visor and decent venting. Shoei fits me best so I was pleased when the GT-Air came on the scene. I picked up the Hi-Viz yellow the instant it was available. So far I've ridden in the helmet from 40F to nearly 90F day and night so I've got a pretty good notion of it's quality and limitations. I haven't tested it in rain yet but I'm sure it won't be long.Top Vent-I have an Arai Profile Takahashi rep and a Shoei X-11 Kiyo rep. Both vent better than the GT-Air. In fact, I'm baffled by this being that \"air\" is the name of this helmet which lacks that very thing. I haven't a single hair on my head so it is easy for me to feel whether a helmet vents well or not. The GT-Air does move some air but not at all like the two aforementioned race lids. I looked in the helmet for any obstructions and there are none. I can even see light through the vent holes and a clear path for air to be moving but only a little comes through at any speed. Having said that, on a 90F day and sweating I never felt my head was boiling like a cheap helmet will do. On a 40F degree ride I can definitely notice the difference opened and closed! It vents, but don't expect it to vent like a racing helmet.Rear vent- I can't tell a bit of difference either way from it.Chin Vent-Works very well at clearing mist from the visor. I don't use the pinlock at night so I rely on the chin vent. It works only when in motion of course just like every other helmet with an effective chin vent.Fit-Superb. Fits like my X-11.Paint-Very nice. Love the yellow. It is very bright, smooth and flawless.Interior-Again much like my X-11. Well done. It doesn't block the top vent holes like on cheaper helmet. Now if only the holes passed more air...Safety-DOT approval is the only thing listed on the helmet. While sufficient, I'd expect better from a helmet in this price range. Dunno if that means it was rushed to the market? No ECE or Snell approval that I could find.Noise-Being my other lids are race helmets they are very noisy. The GT-Air is quiet. Quiet enough to wear without ear pro if you desire. I always wear ear pro but I tried it without and wind noise was much reduced from a racing lid. As some others have mentioned though the helmet does sometimes have a whistle! It's not from the vents because I've checked. It's not the visor. It's the design I suppose. Again I'm thinking Shoei rushed this helmet to the market. A lid in this price range shouldn't be making funny noises of any sort. Still it's only at certain speeds and I've only noticed it a handful of times. It's audible even with ear pro. Not a deal breaker for me but be aware.Visor-It's a pain in the butt to remove the visor. Not at all like the X-11. I feel like I am about to break a tab removing it, same for replacing it. Not as good as the X-11 method by far. The new locking tab on the front works well though. The detents are firm.Chin strap. Shoei changed to a button to lock the free end much like Arai. As opposed to the older Shoei method that locked the free end to the steel D ring. It's now clumsier to find the button since it's very close to the base of the strap.Sun Visor-The perfect shade. Not too light, not too dark. Easy to operate. It could come down a little further since the lower half of vision especially peripherally is unshaded. The visor is still low enough that low morning and evening sun is totally blocked. I like it and it was the main feature I was looking for.\n",

      "Way better than my old helmet\n",
      "The pinlock lens and drop down visor work great. Although a previous reviewer mention the helmet was loud, i found it to be much quieter than my old HJC. This helmet made my naked bike way more comfortable to ride on the freeway.Worth the money in my opinion.Two small gripes:1. I would prefer the chin guard to be windproof... i sometimes feel cold air coming up through there (although this would be a benefit in the summer)2. The snap to secure the helmet strap seems to be a little hard to access. It's a bit too high on the strap and hard to get to.My head measured between 60 and 61 cm, so i was between a Large and XL. I went with the large. It was tight at first, especially the cheek pads, but after a couple weeks of wear it now fits perfectly.Overall, I am happy with the helmet and would buy it again.\n",

      "I purchased this for an upcoming coast 2 coast trip. Being happy with my RF-1000, I was between the RF-1100 & the Quest. Then this helmet was introduced. The visor was what sold me I have put around 1000 miles since receiving it, and i am disappointed. The helmet initially fit tighter then what i was comfortable with compared to my RF-1000. I was actually getting a headache from wearing it. But it broke in nicely, and fits comfortable now. The flip down visor is amazing. It works great and is very clear and optically correct. The Pin lock being included is not only a nice treat, but its a must have since Shoei did a poor job with anti-fog on this model. The pockets inside for speakers are nice, and the quick release tabs to quickly remove all the inside cheek pads is a welcome safety feature. My biggest complaint with this helmet is the noise. I expected a much quieter helmet, considering so few vents (only 2, top & chin) and this is not any quieter then my worn out, beat up, falling apart 8 year old RF-1000. In fact it has this annoying high pitch whistle that starts at around 75-80 mph and no matter what i do i can't get rid of it. They give you some silicon gel to get a better seal (apparently they knew of the problem) but it did nothing to silence the noise.So, overall a good helmet, comfortable after breaking it in, good anti-fog 'only' with the pin-lock installed, loud with plenty of wind noise and whistles to keep you entertained, and nice features like the speaker pockets and the flip down visor.GOOD HELMET...NOT GREAT...SHOULD BE FOR THE PRICE !!!\n",

      "Wow, let me just start by saying that I found exactly what I was looking for in a helmet, (style, lightweight, high visibility, integrated sun visor, and quality) that a company like Shoei can offer. This is my second Shoei and although my previous one has served me well, I wanted more features, and the GT-Air doesn't disapoint. I purchased the all white since my motorcycle is white as well. First off, Revzilla is super fast in delivering this fine product (one business day!). At first try, the fit is a little more snug than I'm used to, I normally wear a Medium in the Qwest. However, I was advised to stay with the same size and so far it feels like it will break in just fine. The style is race inspired so you have more of a cutaway on the back of the neck for a more comfortable fit if you wear a jacket with a racing hump since many older jackets and helmets have had this issue. After a quick ride I immediately noticed that it was so much quieter than the Qwest and even with the shield fully open at a lower speed there is almost no whistling from the wind. The face shield being Pinlock-ready is a HUGE selling point for me. I can attest to the fog-reducing claims by this product. Having said that, I don't really need to keep the vents open while riding in this cooler weather as it won't really fog up my shield. But if you open the front chin vent, you won't get the cold wind piercing at your face unless you are riding in a touring or upright position which may keep fogging at a minimum to none at all . If you are in the race position you will not feel that much wind which is nice if you must keep the vent open. In the tucked position, you will get a helmet that is much more quieter with less wind flow but I believe that's why they invented the top and rear vents for the warmer months. On my Qwest I would have to close all the vents in order to keep all of the wind chill from freezing my lips and nose. Overall you're getting all your money's worth with this helmet. If you buy it, you can be confident you got a great deal The Pinlock shield and lens alone is over $70 so even if you buy a cheaper helmet you may end up paying around the same as the GT-Air after accessorizing with anti-fogging shield and lens. BTW, the helmet looks 10 times better in person, buy it!\n",

      "This is my second Shoei helmet, I own an RF1100 as well. I fit into a medium in both and both helmets seem to have the same fit for the most part.. The GT Air has inserts for the ear area that you remove to put in ear communicator device. these inserts are not in my RF1100 and I had to remove them from the GT Air because they made that area too tight. its much better with them out..Now my ears i would say are of average size but seems like there's no room when the ear inserts are installed. So for now helmet fits pretty darn good we'll see after it breaks in..I bought the white GT AIR... my RF1100 is silver so i wanted something different. I chose white because my thinking is I live in SoCAL and any dark/black helmet can really bake in the sun and I'm trying to stay cool as well as visible. I'm not sure if it will make a difference but in theory it should.. anyway looks good in white except for the vents on top look like cheap add on's.. now i say LOOK not are but look like cheap add on's..and I think its only on the white version because its ALL white i feel like the bottom trim plate on the front and rear vents should have been black or smoke colored like on the silver model. you'll see what i mean if you buy the white.. in the pic its not really noticeable.. maybe is just me. but that is hardly to say anything functionaly is wrong with it..The sun visor works great and does what its suppose to do. there is zero distortion and its so convenient not having to switch smoke and clear pinlock lens like I do on the RF1100.The shield itself works well detents are firm.. i like the locking switch on the RF1100 because it had that slight crack open setting if you wanted just a little more air to creep in... the gt air just closes kinda like a click down thing it does.. but does not lock like the RF1100.Feels close to the same weight as the rf1100 i really cant tell. the GT AIR is much more quieter than the rf1100 for sure.. its a big difference.. as far as riding around town and on the freeway ,i didnt notice anything too different. during head checks they seem the same... maybe the gt air has a slight edge and i think it feels more aerodynamic...also i think the front mouth vent on the rf1100 flowed more air.. and more so at lower speeds i noticed..so do i think its worth it. i would say yes. it is pricey but if you can afford it i don't think you will be disappointed at all.for me Shoei fits my head the best and they are comfortable. i dont want to be thinking about my helmet when im riding i want to concentrate on my riding.. both shoei's for me integrate into my riding seamlessly..\n",

      "Sun shield is awesome!\n",
      "This is my first Shoei helmet and actually my first premium helmet. I ride a Fatboy and I used to wear an HJC 3/4 with a drop down sun visor, so this helmet fit the bill.Tough choice giving up the freedom and viewing angles of a 3/4 and I debated going with the J-cruise as well.Let me just say this helmet surprised me. I'm still breaking it in, but it's snug all around. It doesn't grab my forhead as tight as the quest so it allows me to move my eyebrows a bit, but it's still snug through the temples. The liner lets me slide my glasses on very easily with little to no adjustment. The sun shield comes a lot further down than the HJC did on the sides and is very easy to operate with gloves on. (It looks bad @$$ as well)This helmet is very quiet to me (again compared to an HJC 3/4) even with the shield up at 35-50 mph. The sound from my bike is still muffled (stock Fatboy pipes), but I'm still able to hear voices and cars alongside of me while in traffic.My only complaint is the fogging. (Keep in mind I'm used to riding open face with just my riding glasses) I put the breath shield in and removed the chin curtain which helped alleviate most of the fogging and if you set the shield at the second detente, there's no fogging at all at low speeds. (Japan traffic) I haven't installed the pin-lock which came with it yet, so I may try that later in the spring.Viewing angle is exceptional! I tried the Quest and the GT-air easily has a wider field of view to the sides and up/down. I'm still adjusting to the full face as I have to tilt my head down a few degrees to see the speedometer on the tank. (No biggie since I usually go by gear and engine anyway)Chin curtain: OMG this thing is thick! Feels like there's a triple layer in there with elastic sewn in. Very easy to remove and re-install!I've only got about 25 miles on it and a little over 4-5 hours of wearing it around the house, but it's already forming up nicely through the face and ears for me. (The ears were a little snug pulling it on and off the first few times)Good value, some may say a little pricey, but you get the features and quality you pay for!\n",

      "I just received one of the brand new Shoei GT Air helmets from a pre-order with Revzilla - another fast, flawless transaction, by the way. This will be the 3rd Shoei helmet I've owned, the other two being the Hornet dual sport and RF-1100. I've tried on the Qwest and Neotec several times, so I can speak to the fit comparison to them as well. For this review, I was able to go on a solid 30 minute ride in this helmet at sustained speeds up to 70mph.Right out of the box, the finish quality is everything we've come to expect from Shoei. My helmet is solid white and the paint and clear coat are flawless. I didn’t put the GT Air on a scale but I’d guess it’s about the same weight as the RF-1100. The breath deflector and pinlock lens are included but separate. You’ll want to install both items because like the other Shoei’s I’ve owned the GT Air fogs up easily, if not instantly. The chin curtain is pre-installed and is thicker than other Shoei curtains. It feels like it has a thin layer of foam in between the fabric layers, which I think helps make this a very quiet helmet. You'll get the typical Shoei helmet bag, manuals and decals but also included is a curious little bottle containing silicone oil. This is intended for use on the face shield gasket to promote a better seal. I'm interested to see how that works over time.The liner is plush and padded on the sides but a little rough on top (I'm bald, FWIW#, almost like a soft scouring pad. It’s not uncomfortable, just noticeable. It's the same fabric used on the crown of the liner in my Hornet, which softened up with use. The vents and face shield operate with strong, positive response, though I wish the lowest detent of the shield was a bit lower. The opening is wide, providing excellent periphery vision. I found the “cracked” position to be too small to clear the helmet and my glasses from fog. That’s not a mark against this helmet, just my preference. I particularly like that the GT-Air has a much simplified vent system with one big, easy to find/operate front intake and one equally easy rear exhaust, as opposed to the RF-1100's six, small vents #2 front and 4 rear#. This makes opening and closing all the venting much easier while riding. I ride a V-strom with a Givi windscreen on an adjustable MadStad bracket. The vents on the RF-1100 were just a little too low on the forehead to catch much air without adjusting the windscreen down. The top vent on the GT-Air fixes that issue for me. Regardless of the windscreen position, I get a ton of air through those big vent and exhaust holes on top.The star attraction to this helmet is the internal sun visor. I can testify that it lives up to the hype. The slide mechanism functions very smoothly and positively, is easy to find #even with thick, winter gloves), distortion-free, dark, and drops down further than other internal shades, fully shielding the eyes. I wear glasses and the internal visor was one of the big reasons I bought this helmet. I'm happy to report that my glasses slip very will into the helmet and to not interfere with the sun visor. I have a Sena Bluetooth system in my helmet, which sits just below and well clear of the visor slide.FIT: First of all, it's true to Shoei sizing. I'm a medium in every other Shoei helmet and I'm a medium in the GT Air. However, not all Shoei helmets fit the same. For me, the Qwest is just too roomy around the top and sides of my head. I can almost rotate it forward and off my head. A size smaller is hard to get on and very painful against my forehead. The hornet fits my head snug and secure all around. The RF-1100 is an excellent fitting helmet as well, slightly less snug than the Hornet on me and easier to put on and take off. I was considering buying the next larger size of cheek pads for the RF-1100 before the GT Air was announced.I've heard it said that the fit of the GT Air is similar to the new Neotec. I've tried on the Neotec at a local retailer and I would say that's probably a fair comparison around the crown of the head. Both are what I consider solidly intermediate oval. However, it's an unfair comparison around the cheeks, chin and lower part of the head. A full-face helmet is by design stiffer around the lower portion of the shell and simply has more area for larger, longer cheek pads and more bolster around the neck. And cheek pads are what this helmet has in abundance. They are thicker out of the box than those in the Hornet, RF-1100, or Qwest. This can make the GT Air feel pretty tight when you first go to put it on. In fact, it's definitely more work to get on than the RF-1100 or Hornet. The fit is very snug but not uncomfortable. I've never been certain what \"race fit\" is but I have to think the fit of the GT Air approaches it.The result of the thicker cheek pads, padded liner, and padded chin curtain is a quieter helmet. I think it’s significantly more quiet than the RF-1100, especially at speeds below 55mph. At 60mph and higher, no helmet is quiet enough to wear without earplugs, IMO and the GT is no exception. Absent from this helmet however, is any whistling through the vents or a cracked open face shield.Like my other Shoei's, I expect the GT Air to have a break-in period, eventually softening a bit and conforming more to my head. All in all, I’m extremely impressed and pleased with the GT. It’s a pricy helmet, but I think in this situation, you are getting what you are paying for: a high quality, safe, feature-packed helmet that works extremely well. And it looks great too.Dave ClarkSpokane, WA‘08 DL650 V-Strom\n",

      "Finally! A helmet that fits me...\n",
      "I went through 4 helmets before I landed on this one. My head is BIG (62 cm) and XL, 2XL was not working. This did. The cheek pads (20 mm) were still a problem, had to get the 14 mm cheek pads, and that is just - alright. Life with a big head is not easy! The 3XL fit perfectly otherwise. The chin piece lifts easily and locks easily. The visor moves up and down reasonably well, as does the boss sun visor. I am a new rider, so not going too fast yet. I could imagine this helmet is going to be loud. Totally satisfied so far, would buy again in a heartbeat.\n",

      "Great starter helmet & comes in 5XL\n",
      "This was my first motorcycle helmet.  It was difficult to find a full face helmet to fit my big ole noggin, but this one fit great.  The 5XL is essentially the 3XL with slimmer pads (that part is a little scary), but it feels safe and is rather comfortable. However, I did not have enough room to wear sunglasses comfortably with the helmet.It is pretty light for such a large helmet, and I didn't experience any fatigue after long rides (e.g. a few hundred miles). The air vents do a good job keeping you cool, and I do not have too much trouble in the winter months in the DFW area.  (For winter, you will need to pick up a chin curtain, though.  It's not included.) Hearing is definitely not an issue; you don't feel cut off from the outside world.  No need for hearing protection for the backroads, but it is probably a wise thing for highway trips.The visors switch out very easily.  It comes with a clear visor and I keep a tinted one in my saddle bag. It does fog up on me, but I invested in a Pinlock shield (not included) for each visor which works its magic to keep your field of vision clear.I like this helmet, and I would by another one when the time comes.\n",

      "This is one of the best value helmets you can buy. For the cost what you get is pretty great. It's not only a DOT helmet but also Snell certified so you can take it to racing events. The fit is a little small so if you're at the top of a size range get one bigger. The air flow to the visor is slightly poor and it fogs up on really cold or rainy days, but this is solved with the pin lock screen.Overall I knew what I was buying and I am satisfied with my purchase.\n",

It is a little loud but you should expect that from a high air flow helmet.  It allows you to hear the traffic around you.  If I get bored with white I can always add stickers or paint it.  I will buy another HJC.\n",

      "This is my very first helmet, so I have nothing to compare it to other than a borrowed, way too large helmet. I found this helmet to be a perfect fit for me, besides the cheek pads. I have a very small head with a normal sized face, so I ordered the xs based on the sizing chart. With the xs the cheek pads were 40mm which made the fit uncomfortable. I ordered the next size down which were the 35mm. That made all the difference. My helmet now fits perfectly. Swapping out the cheek pads was super easy. Air flow is excellent. Noise level is average. I would definitely buy this helmet again.\n",

Remember, the shell for the small and the extra small are the same, the padding is what changes for this size. So I have an extra small with larger padding. My head look big when I have this on. I wear ear plugs whenever I ride (recommended) I met a moto guy once and he had lost most of his hearing. He had me a pair of ear plugs. Still have this helmet. Works great. Looks great.

For years, I've been putting off getting a new helmet, because I didn't want to spend $700 on a new Arai, or switch to a crappy cheaper helmet.I'm so glad I finally got this.  It's great.  it looks really great.  I also got the gold face shield, which I'm very happy with.The weird part is, my head measures 25\" = 63.5cm, which is exactly in the middle of XXL in the size chart, but the XXL absolutely crushed my head, and the 3XL fits great.  I've only ridden in it for two days, almost two hours.It's a shame I can't include my photo of how good it looks with my bike.\n",

There are three vents, when all three opened, that bring in a soft breeze at 30-40mph cruising speed esp to remove breath condensation on visor. Use tinted safety glasses with thin temples in order to slide them in onto your ears. Very comfy padding (size L) like a pillow but snug fit around your cheeks; you'll get used to the weight after wearing for a few hours; it's fairly light.\n",

Going into my second riding season, I've actually taped over the insides of the passive cheek vents with gaff tape, and I've covered my (not included) chin curtain with tape as well, to try and cut down on wind noise. It is pretty noisy at highway speeds, where earplugs or sound blocking earbuds. Looks great with a smoked out visor, pinlock works great.\n",

      "Can't say enough. I live in Florida, so airflow is a must but I refuse to wear an open face helmet. (I ride a Bonneville t120 so the open face helmets are the vintage look as well) all the vents do a great job of cooling and visibility is great. Had my first crash this week, and helmet did it's job. No concussion, visor stayed on and down. Had I been wearing that vintage style helmet I'd have no face right now.

      "It's a loud one and doesn't fit speakers perfectly\n",
      "It's a loud helmet.The face shield scratches pretty much as soon as you get it. It's incredible how delicate that is. On top of that, the clarity through the face shield is... well, subpar. It's got some distortion and has some haloing.The other issue is that when you put speakers into this helmet, if your ears stick out just a little then you will have an issue with your ears hitting the speakers. Annoying. If there was just a couple more mm of space, this wouldn't be a problem. Maybe this is just a symptom of my sizing (I ordered a Large and it was true to size for my melon). In terms of sizing, they include *very* small cheekpads in this helmet. I had to order the largest available cheekpads in order to get this to fit my face. Even then, after some months of use, the cheekpads have compressed down quite a bit. This now moves on my melon a bit more than I'd like because the cheekpads aren't pressing on my face much.I'm a pretty round melon so I don't have many options. It was this or an Arai that's close to 5-6x the price. I went with this for my first choice since it was about 1/6 the price. Now that I'm more invested in this hobby, I might go with an Arai. The loudness is cured mostly by really effective earplugs but sometimes it gets so loud that it's unpleasant. I can't imagine using this at the track. It's that loud. Even with earplugs, if you've got a 100mph wind on your bucket then it's unpleasant. Hearing damage is a funny thing. It's progressive so you won't be sure if you just got used to the \"loudness\" or if you've got permanent damage. If it ever hurts, just go slower, use ear plugs, and don't ever just bare with it. It's not worth it.\n",

If I had a fade like I used to I could probably get away with a 3XL but I actually have to wear a 4XL (67-68cm). If you are like me and have a big head, sorry but you probably won't get to have any other full face helmets than these. I've searched and searched and haven't been able to find any other 4XLs.Still a great helmet. The drawback for big heads is that it's only DOT at the bigger sizes. Bummer. Really wish they would go ahead and make it ECE rated. Would definitely be willing to pay the extra cash for more protection. Especially at such a good price already.\n",

      "Good value oriented helmet.  Note that it truly is a round oval fit.  That creates an issue for me on longer rides since I'm more of an intermediate oval head shape.  Short rides it feels fine around town, but 2+ hours and my forehead is throbbing.  I think it is because most of the weight ends up resting on my forehead.  Add to that that it seems to be a bit of a heavy helmet.One other drawback is the dual-position ratchet on the face shield.

The curtain doesn't come back far enough for me so there is still quite a gap.The chimney vents do flow a fair amount of air, though the brow vent I don't feel at all. Open or closed makes no difference to me. That said the chin vent took a bit for me to figure out as i didn't feel any air at first. Once I installed the chin curtain then i could feel the air on either side of my mouth.Though the helmet is Snell rated it doesn't say which Snell rating it has. So those of you that do track days this may or may not be an issue.

I had a snob's reaction to HJC as a bottom feeder. BUT, I watched the video, liked what I saw/heard, and decided to try it.Wow! I have one of those earth/round heads, 56 cm. This is that rare helmet that fits like they used my head for the mold. The small is nicely snug, even contact all the way around, lining quality is nice. It's a bare bones helmet, no chin curtain, limited detents, but so what? DOT/Snell for that price!! The vision is the best of any  I have, even my Shark Vision R that got scraped to hell in a crash, like you're not wearing it. It's plenty warm in chilly, rainy Seattle, the pin-lock shield is excellent, and it looks great, has the minimalist look I prefer.Really, my only gripe is the double d-rings need a tab for opening, but that's it.In summation, hell's bells, it's a keeper.\n",

      "As an avid motorcyclist of nearly 40 years I've had quite a few helmets. I'm amazed HJC has made this cl-17 such a great value. It compares well with helmets costing 4x as much. I don't think there is a better helmet available anywhere near this price point. Ventilation is very good, face shield works well, with strong detents to keep it open even at highway speed if you choose (assuming you wear eye protection such as sun glasses underneath).  I ordered this helmet minutes after 5pm and received it the following day just after 6pm. I'm still stunned at the speed of FREE shipping. Thanks Revzilla! To be objective, it isn't the quietest helmet I've owned, nor the loudest. And I don't know how \"durable\" it will be that's to be seen over the next couple years. But a Snell rated helmet at this price point is tough to complain about. It would be nice to get the chin curtain with the helmet as opposed to being an optional extra, as well as the pin lock shield (it comes pinlock ready, but without the pinlock interior piece.) but even with those extra expenses, it's still a fantastic deal on a quality helmet.\n",

      "This helmet is a great deal. With Snell certification, I am confident it will protect me in the case of a get off. The only problem I have with the helmet is the noise level. This thing is LOUD! Over 25 MPH, this helmet is so loud that I need to wear earplugs for just bumming around town. I will eventually buy a better helmet, but for a cheap reintroduction to safe riding, or for an occasional passenger, this one is hard to beat.\n",

      "I've had this helmet for a year now and it's been awesome. Highway riding is a little loud but for a Snell approved helmet  for under $150 you can't beat it. It fits my Sena 10B well and the fact that you can remove the liners is a nice feature. Air flow with the vents could be better but when it's 24 F outside and you go riding with the vents closed you will still get a lot of that air.Another awesome plus with HJC is cheap face shields c:\n",

      "Good helmet for big heads.\n",
      "I bought this helmet because I have a big head and HJC makes helmets for big heads.  According to the size chart I should be an XL but actually I'm wearing a 3XL.  But in helmets it really has more to due with the shape of your head and not the measurement.  The air flow in this helmet is pretty good and that's saying something cause I live in southern California.  The visor works well but it could use an extra detent at the bottom for a \"city position\".  Really an overall good helmet for the money.  Now the Cons.  The venturi vents on the sides near the jaw are quite loud while riding and can be a little annoying. I ride a Harley bagger so I just turn up the music.  It also does catch wind a bit when turning your head but its not crazy.  The look and profile of this helmet are cool.  If your looking for a cheap but safe full face helmet this is a good option. I will say though that if I had a smaller head I might have gone with a better more expensive helmet.  P.S. The stickers come off real easy.\n",

The CL-17 was a true surprise: I was seriously impressed with its DOT AND Snell  acknowledgements, but the biggest deal was when I tried one on: amazingly good fit for my noggin. snug without the vise-grip effect (a helmet should *never* feel loose, or anything approaching loose). Ventilation works well in warm weather, but just as important, seals quite well for Northeast winters (which I do ride if snow and ice aren't a big factor). And, for what it's worth, it's not hard on the eyes, but when you're riding, how big a deal is that? Highly approved.\n",

      "Disappointingly Loud\n",
      "Picked up a HJC CL-17 Helmet in solid white to replace my ancient Scorpion EXO-700 (which itself succeeded a long line of Shoei RF models). Pros: Make no mistake - the fit and finish on the HJC-CL17 is really good for the $. The faceshield seals well against its grommet, the eye port is huge, and vents are easy to operate with gloves. The liner pads and interior shape are very comfortable from the outset, although I did have to swap out the stock 35mm cheek pads in my Large for a 30mm set, which made the fit about perfect.Cons:Noise. And this is a big one. Even coming off premium Shoei's, I'd still really be loving this helmet in almost every respect except the noise. I always wear earplugs, and even with the firelights in, the roar is to the point of distraction as soon as I'm underway on my '07 FJR1300. By comparison, the Scorpion EXO-700 was quiet to the point of not really \"needing\" earplugs at all. I went with the HJC-CL17 because reviews had pegged the Scorpion EXO-710 as \"noisy\" as well as having issues with cheekpads popping out, but now I feel I pulled the trigger too soon.Chinstrap: the chinstrap lands further back on my throat than any other hemet I've ever worn. The distance as best I can measure is about 2mm closer to my throat than my Scorpion strap, but it makes the difference, as the HJC strap sits right at the notch above my adams apple which isn't comfortable. Perhaps with enough daily wear, I'll be able to get it to sit a bit more forward.Shield: The shield could use at least a 4th notch between the lowest and mid positions, as the mid position is too high and allows air/debris to hit your eyes, while the lowest \"cracked open\" position doesn't really flow a lot of air behind the FJR fairing.. Its a nitpick, but really affects the quality of the ride after awhile.2007 FJR1300\n",

      "This is an excellent helmet and should be on everyone's list for entry level helmets. This helmet looks great, offers both Snell and DOT ratings, and has nice airflow features. The interior of the helmet also feels quite luxurious for the price point. I am overall very pleased with the helmet overall. I feel that the airflow around the mouth could be improved, as I fog up the face shield quite easily and I am not in a particularly cold climate. Also, the helmet itself is quiet large in size (not in fit, just the exterior dimensions.) I suspect this is in order to provide excellent safety without using some of the more high end materials found in other brands, so they keep the relative price point down. The size doesn't bother me and will not be noticeable when you ride, but put it along side a similar sized helmet of a higher end brand and it is definitely noticeable. Not a big gripe though, so far it has been a fantastic purchase.\n",

But it's annoying and people stare at me and notice it.~It's slightly heavy, I mean for the price it is light. But with this helmet + my sena + my go pro it is just too much for my neck to handle.

If you don't ride with these extras then you should be fine.~Didn't come with a chin curtain, I was able to buy one though for it.~The medium is usually what I wear but it was too loose on this helmet and the small fits alright, but it is a bit on the tight side.~speaker cut outs were not large enough too.

It accepts the clamp-on dock for my Cardo system, too. It's fairly heavy, but there's no side to side buffeting, and the face shield mechanism is... well, a chimpanzee can do it. It's definitely well-ventilated, and the pinlock insert is a good touch for fall/spring riding.However, there are problems.It's really really noisy. The brow vent catches air and makes noise, and the face shield gasket has *never* sealed properly on mine. Both the shields I have leak on the side nearest the change mechanism.The raising/lowering mechanism has also gotten much more difficult to engage recently. It used to take a light touch, now you have to hulk it up there. I think it might be time for a new helmet.Difficulties aside, I have worn this helmet every day in a New Mexico summer for 6 months of summer commuting, camping, and adventuring, and if I had to do it again, I probably would. It's an inexpensive pass to motorcycle safety, and with a cheap Cardo unit you can have music and GPS too.\n",

If you keep the visor all the way down then your airflow will suffer for that at anything under 60 mph, but with the visor cracked this helmet actually keeps you from over heating. I have put about 1,300 miles on this helmet in the dead of summer and it has started to break in very nicely but is still snug enough so that I feel safe in this helmet. I plan on buying a visor to use with the pinlock system to prevent fogging in the weather, and for a lower end helmet I feel that the noise is very well managed by the shell and no ear plugs are necessary to enjoy your ride, even on the highway.

      "My older, cheaper helmet was leaving me choked and cramped. I decided it was time for an upgrade. Enter the CL-17. The main things I was looking for were ventilation and comfort, and the CL-17 has both of these things in spades. I would ride around with the face shield up in my old helmet. That is no longer necessary due to the great ventilation system this helmet has. When you open up the upper vents, you can see directly into the helmet. No screens, no foam. The cloth interior soaks up sweat from riding during those hot Texas days better than any helmet I've had before. It's very comfortable to keep on your head for hours on end.My only issues with this helmet are size related. Once it's on, it fits fine. Putting the helmet on requires a little pressure and removal of glasses. The helmet also does not fit in the frunk of my NC700x, but I can't fault the helmet too much with that.\n",

Touch hot in summer but I cracked the visor and I'm good. Spring in visor is perfect closing from cracked position at highway speed. I sport tour and the air flows best in a semi upright position.Visor release is easyNoise is OK. Wear ear plus like you should and it will never bother you.I washed it.... A lot.

      "I wanted to buy an additional helmet to turn into a replica of an Ohio State Football helmet. The HJC CL-17 Helmet had the perfect silver match to make a copy of a Buckeye football helmet and had plenty of good reviews. So, I went ahead and bought the helmet and the black HJC HJ-09 Face Shield and ordered a pack of OSU football helmet stickers. The HJC, DOT, and Snell stickers came off easily. Then I put the Ohio State stickers on the helmet. There was some difficulty putting the center sticker on in a few areas, but overall it came out good for a rookie.The helmet fits better and is more comfortable than my ICON Alliance Battlecry helmet. The shield comes on and off very easily. The helmet has good vision and airflow. I used to have to prop up my visor at stoplights to keep it from getting foggy, however, I haven't any issues with ventilation yet. It is a bit louder than some of my past helmets, but only at speeds that are well in excess of the speed limit. Overall, this helmet is comparable to helmets that cost twice as much.\n",

      "Good helmet at a really good price\n",
      "The pros:A really good helmet at a really good price. Looks great, too. The HJC sticker on the front peeled off really easily with my fingernail.DOT and Snell certified, for less than $150!It comes with a pin-lock ready visor, which saves you the cost of buying a new visor if you want to use a pin-lock aniti-fog lens. I love the pin-lock anti-fog lens. You have to buy the lens separately.Good venting, easy to open/close with gloves on.True to size, comfortableI really like this helmet, and would buy it again.The cons:I don’t really have any cons, unless I start comparing it to the Shoei RF-1100 I had been borrowing before I bought this.The notes below are just in comparison to a Shoei RF-1100. The HJC costs less than half the price, but you lose the luxury.The HJC is not a premium helmet.The HJC doesn’t feel as form-fitting on my head. It’s not loose, it just doesn’t have that feeling of even contact everywhere without some parts squeezing a little more than others.The chin strap is not as comfortable. I think it’s the placement. With the Shoei, you forget it’s there. With the HJC, you are reminded each time you move your head.There is more airflow under the chin. I will buy the chin curtain and the breath guard and see if that takes care of that situation.The HJC is less aerodynamic. When I turned my head at highway speed, the wind made it a little hard to turn forward again. It’s not terrible, but I never noticed this with the Shoei.I don’t think it’s any louder that the Shoei, so it’s got that going for it.Summary:The pros definitely outweigh the cons. The helmet costs less than half of price of the Shoei. You lose some of premium feel. The HJC is a very nice helmet.\n",

      "Great helmet for the price\n",
      "The CL-17 is a great helmet for the price.The air flow around the head isn't noticeable, but neither is hot human air, so the venting works. The chin vents however are useless. To avoid fog just leave the visor cracked until speed forces it down.This thing is heavy, but the price suggests this will be your first helmet so don't worry too much.removing the visor is very simple and only takes a second.The big negative in my opinion is that there are only 2 shell sizes. Meaning that if you are like me, and have a large size head, you get the same shell size to fit 3 sizes above you. The result is a big stupid looking helmet. If you have a giant head, no problem. or if you are a size medium, then you get the smaller shell size.The protection is good though. Snell rated and HJC gets good STARS ratings\n",

In the beginning I got an occassional headache, probably due to the pinching and improper position of it on my head, and also has not fully broken in. Several rides later the headache disappear, and it got a lot more comfy. Airflow is great, esp with the vents open. No observable fogging. Sound level seemed to be minimal but again it's at low speed. Wish the shield positions of open are more varied. It either open fully; shield bottom line at eye level; or barely a crack; and complete closure. It can be quickly swap in and out though. Visibility is great.

Now i know what a helmet is supposed to feel like. I am between sizes, so after reading the reviews, I got an XS when i saw that someone had a similar situation. It is a perfect fit, if a little snug but only in the checks, which will loosen in time. I have only worn it in cold weather so far, and I noticed the vents on top do let air flow through, even when closed. I hope this will be good during the summer months but when I ride in the winter, I feel my forehead getting a little cold. The noise is a bit much on the highway but nothing terrible and I will be getting the pinlock lens insert since it fogs up and the face shield it comes with already has that capacity.

Airflow was good enough to keep from fogging up on a 38 degree morning as long as I kept moving, and I did not notice any unexpected drafts. I haven't really found myself missing having more positions on the visor, but I will note that my CL-14 I had before had much more adjustability at the visor.One thing to keep in mind, and I saw this mentioned elsewhere, is that the helmet seems more designed for the upright \"cruiser\" seating position than the \"sport\" position. On my FZR600 when doing highway/interstate riding (70ish MPH), I notice a lot of wind noise when I duck down, but it is almost completely silent if I sit up really straight.

      "Very impressed with this helmet for the price. I have a giant head and the 3xl fits me perfectly. It's a little on the noisesy side but so is the next level up. The flat black finish is pretty tough, I dropped my helmet but was able to cushion the fall with my foot yet the helmet still rolled on the blacktop and not so much as a scratch. Face shield did fog up like any other shield does so I bought a pinlock visor and the fog is a thing of the past.\n",

      "Coming from a very budget $50 full face helmet this was a massive improvement for me. I found it a good weight and flows a large amount of air which is great for Florida weather. It does fog a bit when at a stop light but quickly disappears once your moving again. I found it very snug when new but after only a few rides it has relaxed to a great fit. And the Snell approval at such a low price was a big plus for me. Overall I definitely recommend this helmet. The low price is a big bonus.\n",

      "Having used several of the CL series helmets over the past 8 years I'll be returning to the more expensive Shoei.This new version has vents that leak horribly at highway speeds and the company knows it. That doesn't seem to make any difference however as they don't fix the problem. I bought one and they won't take it back not that it would do much good since most, if not all, share the same leaky vent closures.The CL-16 was a far better vent design if you like to have them closed. At least my head wasn't cold.\n",

This one is perfect, a little wider and larger size too, so I don't feel like my skull is getting squished in a vice. Airflow is good I've used it from 40 degrees to 90 degrees and at speed the airflow is great, especially on the top front vents. Keep in mind though, over 2xl and it is not SNELL only DOT approved. Great bang for the buck though.\n"

      "By far the BEST helmet for your money!\n",
      "To start, this helmet is absolutely amazing! I got the white for better visibility and love it. The visor is HUGE which doesn't obscure your vision one bit. The first time riding with this, I thought for a second that I didn't even have my helmet on because it is super comfortable and has such a wide view through the visor. The air flow is good, but of course it gets hot when going really slow or when stopped. It's also a VERY quiet helmet. I used to wear earplugs almost everywhere I went and now I don't need to. Even going 70+ down the highway it's quieter than some of my other helmets when I'm only going about 30 or 40. Some of my friends even said they would prefer my CL-17 over their $500+ Shoei and Arai helmets after I let them test it out. Seriously the BEST purchase I've made so far!\n",

      "Upgrade from a brain bucket\n",
      "I purchased this helmet to get more protection than my 1/4 helmet as well as some more protection from the elements in cooler temps. I didn't expect to like it so much, and I certainly didn't expect to want to wear it all the time.This helmet certainly isn't a super slender or super light-weight one, and the wind resistance is a bit high. This is really noticeable when pulling around large trucks or when turning your head at all on the highway. This isn't going to stop me from using the helmet more often, though.Noise levels are so far below a 1/4 helmet, I almost feel like I can't review this aspect. But, the noise is comfortable with no whistle or odd noises to annoy on longer rides. The padding cut-outs around the ears are really comfortable as well, allowing some air to get around them so they aren't hot and sweaty.The vents offer a little cooling, which makes it a bit more comfortable on warmer days. But a helmet is a helmet and if you aren't moving in hotter temps, you're going to get warm. The chin vent slows fogging down, especially when the brow vent is open and a little air is moving past them. But, in general, cracking the visor open is enough to keep it from totally fogging up on cooler nights when you're stopped at a light.The pin-lock system is interesting, but ultimately I just purchased a smoked visor for the helmet. I prefer the privacy and I prefer to have the full shield dark rather than just most of it. The pin-lock pins are far enough to the side that they're basically out of sight, so they won't impact your view. But, I may well buy a shield that doesn't have the pins on it.I purchased the flat black finish, which I would do again. But, after several weeks of almost every weekday use it's showing a few scuffs and marks. I'm pretty careful, but putting the helmet down top first on a table is a great way to get some nice white scuffs on it. The fact that the scuffs are white only makes them stand out more. But, frankly, it's a helmet and i'll be hit by enough road debris soon that it will have more battle scars than not. Washing the outside with just a wet paper towel or some mild dish soap is enough to get bugs and finger marks off it, so that's pretty good. I just wouldn't scrub the flat black like you could with a glossy finish.\n",

Love this helmet, also bought the pinlock insert which works great. Pretty quiet, blocks out high pitched noise well, although there is a slight low \"rumble\" that still gets through. Going to get the chin curtain, which might help further. Very happy I bought this instead of the Qwest, fits me even better, seems the same quality/protection, great price.

      "Let me tell you, this helmet is a diamond in the rough. Its quiet, light, stylish, DOT rated, and inexpensive. The HJC CL-17 has also reduced the buffet I was experiencing on my bike also. There is a great seal around the face shield which reduces wind noise.The fit is good. It fits a very round head shape. I wish that it fit a little bit more oval, but that just my head. I have a huge freak-sized head so I need an XXL. It fits me well, but I wish the cheek pads pushed out a little more and had more contact on the sides of my face.The air vents works ok. Top vents and brow vents flow air to the head, but the chin vents doesn't seem to do much. I've experienced a lot of fogging in the helmet at stops. cracking the windshield helps stop that. The fogging my come from it being in the 30 degree range the first few times I wore it. On warmer days I experienced much less fogging but still some. I don't like that.I do wish it came with a chin curtain. Ill be ordering one from Revzilla soon along with some different face shield for add sun protection and to look sweet!So I guess those were some complaints. Its easy to complain about things, but again, this helmet is inexpensive so I didn't expect perfection. Honestly, I expected a cheap helmet, but the HLC CL-17 is not cheap in quality. Great helmet, amazing price point.My opinion may be skewed a bit due to the fact that I bought these helmet to replace a 15 year old, modular helmet that was pretty much falling apart.\n",

Which I won't compare the CL17 to because its apples and oranges really, so much has changed over the years this new CL is miles ahead of that old model, modular or not. Fit and finish is top notch, fitment is perfect for me based on the chart, I measured at 22\" and the small is exactly what I needed. The snell m2010 approval really sold me on it, just because I'm a scooter rider doesn't mean that at 60mph my head will hit the ground any different than a sport bike at the same speed. Its a major plus to have snell certification in this price bracket. Very good ventilation and surprisingly quiet as well. I bought the matte finish and its flawless with no imperfections in the paint and it just looks superb, I would recommend this helmet and revzilla to anyone that just wants a darn good helmet but doesn't want to spend 3 to 4 even 5 times as much on some of the more expensive models.\n",

The helmet fits perfect. The cheek pads were snug for the first few days, but no discomfort. The helmet seems quieter than my FS-15, but the major difference is the airflow. With the vents open, you can actually feel the air coming in. Some things I noticed-there's a rubber seal around the bottom of the helmet that keeps both ends of the lower cheek pads sealed in and the cheek pad/liner snaps have improved quality. I contacted HJC about a chin curtain for the CL-17, they say they will be available soon.\n",

      "Just returned from a 800 mile ride through the Rockies. Like most riders I ride with ear plugs/protection. That said with that addition the helmet is quite quite. Very comfortable. I like being able to lift the face shield a notch or two when motoring through a town at low speeds or clearing a little fog out of the helmet when the humidity is hi. I never had any issues with this helmet and fogging. The additional chin attachment is really cool and helps keep you warm on those cool mornings. I didn't run into any major buffeting when riding at high speeds when riding in low traffic. High traffic, highway speeds did have some buffeting issues due to the visor. But you can take that off if that is your normal riding conditions. I love this helmet and if you're lucky enough to have this helmet to fit your cranium you won't be disappointed. The views are great! I will say to Revzilla that the packaging of this helmet was very poor. I'm surprised  it wasn't damaged or scratched. the original box looked to have been shipped multiple times. Just a loose helmet in a box? Strange!\n",

      "Excellent All-Rounder\n",
      "I've had this helmet for a little over three years, it's been my daily driver on commutes and road trips. I'll start with the good.Using the helmet is easy. The shield moves up and down using just one finger, it has stops to hold it open at various positions while riding. Three years on, the motion of the shield is still smooth and each stop holds securely.The modular chin bar can be raised and lowered with one hand also, though make sure both sides click into place!Removing the peak and or shield is simple and quick, though not particularly fun to do away from the comfort of your couch.The chin and top vents are still firmly in place and work as well as ever. The chin vent lets in plenty of air, though the top vent is a bit harder to tell.Overall the helmet has held up very well. The colors (I bought the yellow & black version) have faded a little, but spending more than 1000 days in the sun will do that to anything.I've replaced the full set of liners twice so far, after about a year, each. Doing so makes the helmet fit like new again and I would recommend this practice to anyone who commutes.The drop-down shade lens is just a tad short, leaving the bottom edge of the plastic in my field of view. It's a minor annoyance, but on longer trips along straight roads in the middle of the day it becomes pretty noticeable having a bright line along the bottom of your vision.The cutout in the cheek pads for glasses work well, helping to guide you glasses in place along the side of your head and not pressing the legs against your skin for hours. The downside is that thinner frames will be able to bounce around a little.The volume inside the helmet isn't too bad, but it is a big, open thing at its heart. It's not too bad in the city and on slower back roads or trails. On the highway, though, bring some ear protection because it's going to get loud. I don't know how it stacks up to similarly priced competition.As far as the bad things go, well, there's just one big one, really.There's no way around it. The included shield (single, standard shield), in spite of whatever fancy chemical they coat it with, fogs right up in cold wet conditions. It has definitely gotten worse over the years I've been riding with it, so the coating does some good, just not much. I'm finally ording the pinlock lens kit, but at the almost $300 price, I feel like it should have come with the pinlock included. Even if the insert lens had to be purchased separately.Even in summer rains, when fog isn't as much of an issue, the shield just doesn't shed water very well. Maybe that's an issue of the angle of the shield (which would be affected by my riding position), but regardless of which of my two bikes I'm on, this helmet doesn't have good wet-weather visibility.Ironically, the drop-down shades do fairly well with both fog and rain.\n",

      "First let me start by saying that I have gone through 3 other helmets before I found this one. There are an adv helmet, a full face, and a modular. My ride is a 2007 Vstrom 650. I ride about 70% pavement and 30% dirt roads. I will break down each segment that is important to me with the pros and the cons. Now on to the review. Fit: A friend of mine has this helmet that is 2 years old. His is a XL. I tried his and it fit fine, so I ordered a XL. When it came I had to push it down on the top of my head. After 30 mins i was getting a headache. I sent it back and got a 2XL. It fits like it should. At first it felt a little tight around my forehead and cheeks. After 300 miles it has broken in and now feels great. Lots of people are saying you should order the next size up cheek pads. After a few more miles I do not think I will need to.  I have notice it is easier to put the helmet on with the chin bar open and then close it. Side note. I can use my camel pack with this helmet closed.Weight: This helmet is a little heavy to me. On the first couple of rides it was noticeable. Not so much now. I realize with all the accessories it will be heavier. I just didn't expect as much. It by no means strains your neck, but you will notice the difference at first.Airflow: With the top vent open I can feel the wind going through my hair as long as I above 25 mph, that is provided the visor is down. I like to ride with my visor open, when I do I get very little to no airflow on top of my head, but of course plenty on my face. Therefore, if I am on dirt I ride with my visor open because of the lower speeds and on pavement I ride with visor closed. I do not feel any air coming through the chin vent.Visibility: The visibility on this thing is amazing. I can barely see the peak above my head and have to move eyes side to side and down to see any portion of the helmet, and then just barely. I cannot speak for fogging at this point because it is midsummer in the south so our night lows are only down in the 60s Fahrenheit. Also, if the visor is up I can just make out the bottom of it above my eyes. The visor stays in whatever potion I put it in up to 90mph. After that I cannot say. Btw you can wear off road goggles with this helmet although I have not so I cannot comment.Sunshade: It needs to be darker and come down about another 1/4 inch or so. I get a small transition where I am seeing shaded and then full sun below. It is not enough to cause problems though but it could be distracting to some although not likely. My son has a Scorpion that is another street model. He says the same thing about his. Hey Scorpion are you listening? It should be noted that I can wear glasses behind the sunshade. It helps if you raise the chin bar when you put them on.Peak: The peak sits just barely in my line of sight above my head. It is low enough that with a slight tip of the head I can block the sitting or morning sun without obstructing my view or being distracting.  Now the bad. At 70 mph it starts to vibrate slightly. At 90 it is enough that my vision was bouncy. It wasn't bad but it was noticeable.  I don't normally ride above 70 but I was testing the limits of the helmet that day. With the peak off there is no vibration that I have noticed.Quietness: Judging from my other three helmets this thing sound like a tomb. It is very quiet in my opinion. The odd thing is it seems quieter with the peak on.Chin bar: It lifts up out of the way with ease and stays up during any movement I have had. It locks in place with a good click. Only once did it fail to lock and think that was my fault. I have notice it is easier to put the helmet on with the chin bar open and then close it.Things I do not like: I got spoiled with one of my other helmets with the ratchet chin strap. I wish this had it. The sunshade needs to be darker and come down just a hair bit more. More air flow at the chin. And of course, the price. Although I have as much money in the other helmets combined that I do in this one and each has a feature I like but not has all the features except this Scorpion. So maybe I should have bit the bullet sooner and just this one to start with. In closing this is an awesome helmet. I am very pleased with it. I wish I had bought one sooner. I used the Affirm app to buy this helmet and it was a breeze. Return of the first helmet was quick and easy with Revzilla getting the return in 3 days and crediting me in 4. There was no problem with the Affirm site with the refund it was instant and painless. I do suggest actually measuring your head and ordering instead of trying on someone else's helmet. I don't know if that would have helped get the right size but it might.Overall, I recommend this helmet for anyone looking for an ADV helmet.\n",

Cheek pads are available to help with fit.  I love the idea of a modular DS helmet particularly vs the Shuberth (which I tried in Germany last year).  It simply would not fit in any size....not to mention the ridiculous cost.  The older Scorpions had removable chin bars that could be replaced by a visor.  I kind of miss the ability to remove the chin bar but have learned to live with it.  After 6 months and several thousand miles I think this is a great product and a great value.\n",

No fogging issues, and the vents cool effectively. Probably a bit warmer then some but not overly hot, liner wicks any perspiration and makes you comfortable.

It fits ok but I probably could have gotten the M for a more snug fit.Other than that, it is a great helmet, large visor, gives wide field of view, has the usual drop down sun visor and being modular can flip the front up.  There are only two intake vents that I could find, one at the front and one at the top.  The helmet seems noisier than my previous helmet, possibly due to the fact its modular and has more spaces for air to sneak in.Overall I like this helmet, probably should have gotten it in size M but it fits ok and isn't flopping around on my head.I would definitely recommend this helmet while it is still available to be bought.\n",

I did order it from a place that said they had it in stock, about $4 for the screw and $11 for shipping... but today got an email \"sorry, we are out of stock\" and won't have it until at least 10/12/18. So my guess is that this is a very common problem. Scorpion, why don't you send every helmet owner free screws and some loctite? I rarely use the outside visor, yet this still came out. Another time I was going down the freeway and the screws had loosened to where the visor popped straight up at 90mph... The amount of force on my head was unreal.. it forced my head back and I was looking straight up at the sky for a few seconds until I simultaneously slowed down and managed to fight my head back down.\n",

      "I have been running an SS1500 for the last five years.  I decided to upgrade to the AT950 in an effort to get more air to my head.  I live in Houston, TX ,and it gets HOT down here.  We also have very high humidity, so all of that evaporative cooling stuff doesn't work for squat.I got really brave, and the first trip I took with this helmet was from Houston, TX to Daton, OH and back.  Having a modular helmet is wonderful!  Being able to completely open the front and stuff your face at the gas station is totally worth it.The peek does a good job of slicing through the wind when you are looking forward.  If you want to look to the side, I recommend you tilt your head down just a little because the peek will catch wind in a side on configuration, and it's much more comfortable with the wind pushing your helmet down than pulling it up.  My wife rides without the peek, and I ride with mine on.  It is higher than a baseball cap, so it's not the most efficient at sun up / sundown, but during the afternoon, it does a good job keeping the hot sun out of your eyes and off your face.Airflow is MUCH better than in my ss1500.  It ran from the mide 80's to the mid 90's on my entire trip, and I was grateful to have this helmet instead of my older one.The drop down visor is VERY nice, and below 50mph, it's comfortable to ride with it down and the face shield open.  IT was  real help going through some of the \"speed trap\" towns in North Texas.  I still bought a smoked visor, and It is no problem to run with the smoked visor and the drop down visor when you're headed into blinding sun.I also run a Sena 20s with my Scorpion.  They fit well together, and the speaker pockets in this do a great job of holding the speakers.  I had to cut holes into the foam of my old ss1500 to get them to fit, so I was grateful that this helmet is designed for high tech.  I'm also using the half boom mike, and it is working very well.The helmet is NOT dead quiet.  You still need ear plugs.  I found some ear buds that look and work like ear plugs.  I plugged them into the Sena, and they work very well for both clear sound and noise reduction.  Having the modular helmet makes getting the helmet on and off without pulling your ear buds out possible.\n",

Could use some more ventilation.  When is hot (80-95 degrees) I lift the clear front shield and lower the tinted flip down shield for much more air flow.  When it's cool (40-75) helmet is perfect. My sena speakers and mic fits perfect inside.  With the clear shield down,  I can talk on the phone at 70mph without the other person knowing I'm on the bike. The ability to flip the face front up is nice for talking too someone when stopped.  2nd scorpion I've owned.  I wear a small-medium flex fit, or 7 - 7 1/4 ball cap.

      "AT950 is my first dual-sport multi use helmet, as well as the first modular I've purchased. After roughly 1000 miles of mostly commuting and small roads I am extremely satisfied and can't really imagine a better helmet for any money.Fit and finish appear first rate and the sizing exact. Removal of the cheekpads and liner is relatively easy and nothing to complain, especially for my non-sport duty where washing is not constantly needed. Strap is the old-fashioned double-D type with a snap for the loose end to prevent flapping at speed. Helmet feels slightly heavy, I guess price to pay for having a modular construction.The face shield gives very wide view. It appears optically excellent, no distortions, reflections or the like. It seals well against the opening and locks up, down and three positions in-between.The internal sun visor is handy and easy to operate. It sits far away from face that even moderately large eyeglasses fit nicely underneath. It will somewhat block/distort the lower edge of your vision so you may have to move your head a bit to see the gauges.The peak position can't be adjusted. It sits fairly high, you can barely see the edge above the top of the view port. Slightly lower would suit me better to use as total sun blocker. It locks in place by pin on the helmet and indention on the visor so changing the position would take some tinkering.Noise level is low to average at moderate speeds. At 70+ speeds there is a significant increase in wind noise and buffeting, much bigger increase than for my track helmet (likely the peak is to blame for this). For me ear plugs are a must.Peak and visor removal is by screws with coin slots, no quick-connects here. Feels nice and sturdy and I don't foresee changing them often enough for extra time to make any difference.So I am very satisfied and besides the minor issues of peak non-adjustability there isn't a single thing I would change.\n",

      "Overall a decent helmet, and a good value for a modular.  The modular feature is great for those of us who wear glasses. Easy to flip up when getting gas, reading a map or even blowing you nose.   I bought this helmet for the peak, thinking that it would keep low sun out of my eyes.  The peak doesn't really do this too well since it sits fairly high up.  I guess it's more meant for off-road use, keeping branches from hitting your face, etc.  I removed the peak, and am just using the helmet with the visor.  The helmet is pretty comfortable, especially with the roomy chin-to-chin bar distance.  I'm not constantly kissing the chin bar.  I fit a Scala bluetooth unit onto the helmet easily.  The drop down sun visor is moderately useful, although it doesn't resolve glare, just dims the light a bit.  There is some wind noise from the top vent.  When closed, the vent rattles a bit.  I taped it down for Winter riding, and that's fine.  I also detected some wind noise from the side plates that cover the visor hinges. I reduced this with, and here's an odd tip, sticking some black velcro strips (the softer side) vertically on the visor just in front of the side plates.  The velcro seems to deflect, slow down or somehow disrupt the air flow enough to reduce the noise.  Sort of like the Cat Ears product that bicyclists use on their helmets.\n",

Being a modular helmet, it does provide you with many options for additional airflow and the retractable sun screen works well for me. The price point is very good for this helmet.

I use my Arai only locally now, as this helmet is much better for ADV touring. The shield is more optically correct (Arai is terrible and gives headaches it’s so bad, it vents just as well,  and doesn’t fog in the rain like my Arai does (even with the pinlock, which never seemed to work properly, even after trying two shields and 2 pinlock lenses).  The drop down internal sun visor is a must have for me now.   The cheek pads give you chipmunk cheeks and pressure when new, but it gets better with more wear.  I wear Oakley OTG goggles sometimes with this in warmer weather and they fit fine. I still believe Arai makes one of the highest quality helmets in the world, but for me, for an all around adv helmet, the Scorpion is hard to beat.

      "Really like the Scorpion EXO AT950 but...\n",
      "Scorpion EXO AT950 Neocon size XL, head circumference 23.5\" or 60 cm, more of a long oval head shape I'd guess.For style, looks, function, features the AT950 is hard to beat. I have been a Scorpion helmet fan for a while now, this is my 3rd one. I wanted more of an adventure helmet, so when it was time this was the one.I'll jump right in on my issues with it since we all know the good stuff and features.Fit: I had an Arai XD a while back and it fit just fine. I understand they are a LONG OVAL fit. I'd say the AT950 is more of an INTERMEDIATE OVAL. I say this because of the extra pressure on my forehead I am feeling. It's not a deal breaker, but it's there.Liner: The liner is super plush, except that just above the forehead pads there is a seam that is not exactly flat and it leaves a massive liner mark on my bald forehead (thanks receding hairline). So much so I'm keeping a hat in the tank bag to put on when I go in somewhere until I figure out if this is a defect or not. Other than that It's what I'd expect Scorpion to provide. Oh, the cheek pads are definitely a bit tight, but should break in after a while.Modular chin bar: I'm not so sure what to think about it. It's convenient sure, but I don't think it will provide much crash protection like a regular full-face helmet would. It's pretty thin and hollow in front. I doubt Scorpion would design something that would fail in a crash, so I hope I don't find out the hard way. This is my first modular helmet, jury is out on if it will be my last.Easy SENA 20s install: Installing my SENA 20s was a breeze. It seems like the AT950 was made for it. The speaker recesses fit perfectly and the 20s shape perfectly aligns with the outer shell moulding lines. I have the black/silver Neocon and the 20z just blends in like it was made for it.Overall I like it. Time will tell if I love it or can find ways to love it.\n",

      "Had the helmet for awhile now but finally got the opportunity to shake it down on a long weekend trip. Overall, its good, not great, but very good.    Fits pretty tight around the cheeks, so much so that first morning out I thought it was going to be painfully annoying, it wasn't. By the end of the day I did not have any helmet pain.    Noise level is about average, I always wear earplugs, but when I didn't the noise level was really not that terrible.    Coming home was right into a strong south wind. When the wind was crossing the helmet wanted to turn hard, directly into the wind it was ok unless you turned your head slightly, like to check side traffic. I had the visor installed during the entire trip and I can't help but think/wonder if the visor had an influence on the wind wanting to grab the helmet.    Vision is somewhat limited but not bad, just turn your head a lot to check surroundings, which you should do anyway.   I actually like the distinct three position lens. First notch lets a nice flow of air into the helmet, second notch even more but still protect your eyes, full open is almost like having the chin bar open. Closes with a reassuring \"thunk!\".   Speaking of the chin bar, it is very easy to open, even with gloves on. If your lens is open and you open the chin bar it all folds together nicely. Its sometimes hard to tell if the bar is latched when closing so its a good routine to give it a little push up to make sure it is latched.    Air flow is probably average at best. Air flow is always subjective in my mind based on the bike your on, fairings and type of windscreen can all affect air flow.   The only downside of this helmet that I found was the forehead area padding. It is pretty much like any other helmet except on this helmet it didn't seem to cover the \"transition\" area going forward, if that makes any sense. When removing the helmet it was like hard plastic was scrapping my forehead. I found the best way to avoid this was to pull the cheek guard portions outward and pull the helmet straight up. I may sacrifice another can koozie, my favorite redneck fix,  to see if I can add some padding in the critical areas.   I have not had the chance to check this helmet in rain so I don't know how it performs with rain.   So overall, good helmet, for the low price, a very good helmet. As a side note, I did have an total stranger come up and ask about the helmet at a gas stop, have never had that happen before.\n",

      "Helmet is comfortable, fits well, and works very well. However I found that the visor causes vibration at speeds above 70 which makes this, one of the main features of this helmet, more bothersome to install and remove then its worth. If your wanting a visor'd modular pony on the money for the competition or find the biggest windscreen you can.\n",

      "This is my second helmet i have ever purchased. My first modular helmetPros: - Awesome design - Awesome very clear visor - Very comfortable - Modular feature, one thing i found out after riding with one is, if im riding and i need to sneeze, i can just open it up. awesome to me hahaCons: - Modular helmet wont stay up, it slowly falls down. Not sure if that is normal as this is my first modular but it is a little annoying - Sun visor is not that dark, my oakley sunglasses where much better.I'm definitely happy with the helmet and highly recommend.\n",

      "I've been wanting to change from a touring helmet to an adventure helmet for a while and this helmet was perfect. It looks great with or without the visor. The face shield gives great visibility and seals well. The sun visor works great, has good coverage and is plenty dark. Riding on the road with temps in the 90s, I thought the ventilation was fine - can't comment on off-road riding yet.Its very comfortable, no pressure points and I find it lighter than my previous HJC touring helmet. I love the fact that its modular.Only minor issue: It doesn't work well for glasses. If the stems stick out at all past your ears it will push the glasses forward.I'm very happy with this helmet. At just under $300, its a great value.\n",

      "Great overal helmet. The pros: drop down sun visor, awesome graphic, modular designThe cons: after riding with this helmet for half the summer this is what i've discovered.I would appreciate more venting. Maybe 2 extra brow vents and 2 venturi ventsSlighly loud at freeway speedsThe antifog coating on the shield inside scratches easily(accidently scratched with fingernail)Lastly unwated wind does vent through the gap between the flip up chin bar and helmet shell during crosswinds.Overall a great helmet. It'll be interesting to see how much the high vis green fades. I've been riding with it for 4 months and am noticing some fading between the helmet and peak(peak is usually off)\n",

      "I've intentionally not written about my At-950 purchase for six months as I wanted to give it a few thousand miles on the bike in various weather conditions (Cold/Hot).  I'll start by saying, I ride with some folks who are all \"top end\" geared up (you know what I'm talking about!).  That said, after they have looked at my helmet and the features they've thought I was not telling the truth when I told them it was not in the $500 or plus price point.  This helmet is spot on with what I was looking for in an ADV helmet.  It's well thought out, has all the features I needed and moves enough air to keep me cool while in motion.   I think Scorpion has a winner with this line for sure.  I just hope they don't change it up too much and change the price or make it cheaper for some reason.  One last note my Sena headset fit perfectly on the outside and the internal speaker pockets worked perfect.  I tell everyone about this lid and I would buy another without hesitation!\n",

      "Very pleased with this helmet.\n",
      "I'm very pleased with this helmet with a few exceptions.First I'll talk about the pros. This helmet style is awesome. I like the color scheme and the features. The visor is very clear in easy to move up and down the Sun  pilot visor that flips down and is easily accessible. It does a great job of blocking sunlight. The modular portion of this helmet moves up and down very easily and stays out of your vision if you want it in the fully upright position. The option to put a peak visor on this and remove the front shield to wear goggles is a very nice option for this helmet, easily accept goggles. It's about Midway no real issues with it getting too cumbersome.Here are the cons in my opinion. It's a pretty tight fit even after wearing it for a while. You still get the squish face and kind of gives you a little numbness in the cheek area but hopefully this will go away in time. Wearing this with a Comm unit the pockets inside for the acceptance of the speakers could maybe be a little deeper they seem to only be enough to accept your ears so there's a little bit of pressure on the ear surface. I understand this is a modular helmet and there's a lot of places for air to get through I do wish it was a little quieter when riding. Also I wish there is a little extra wind buffeting under the chin.For the extreme most part I really do like this helmet and I'm happy with the purchase I made. I don't think I'll be buying another helmet anytime soon unless something happens to this one.\n",

      "Great adv style modular for the price\n",
      "Was shopping for a modular adv style helmet and found the options were limited to this Scorpion or the $800 Schuberth. Needless to say, I bought this one.So far, I definitely like this helmet. It's quite comfortable but the size does seem to run small. Based on other reviews I got a 2XL (usually wear an XL) and while the helmet fits well overall, the cheek pads are still a bit tight even after a month of break-in time. Not nearly as bad as they were when the helmet was new, but I'll still be picking up a set of 3XL cheek pads to swap in once they are back in stock.The helmet is a bit noisy, but I ride with the visor up 99% of the time so this doesn't bother me. My one noise related concern is that it seems to be developing a bit more of a whistle sound (rather than just wind noise) as time passes so time will tell how well the seals hold up w/ more use. Maybe I just didn't latch the chin guard down fully when I heard the whistle so might be user error.All said and done I definitely like this helmet, a lot, and would absolutely buy it again. I love the improved airflow of the adv style helmet w/ the convenience of the modular style helmet.\n",

      "Bought this helmet and it fits well, better than my Shoei Neotec. However the helmet is in my opinion too Fragil.  I inadvertently dropped the helmet while holding it to my side and the rear spoiler just broke clean off. It only fell about a foot and a half. Also one of the side screws came off while highway riding. I had previously cleaned the visor and tighten the screw with a quarter. Yet in spite of this the screw loosen and came off while riding. The beak nearly blew off, had to pull over take it off and finish the trip with a fairly unsecured visor. This helmet would have been a great one had the makers thought it out just a bit more and made it just a bit more sturdier. If the helmet breaks and falls apart this easily, I really can't in good conscience recommend it.\n",

      "Fantastic helmet for the price.\n",
      "After riding cross-country on my Bell RS-1 and leaking water down the visor the whole way, I was motivated to get a better touring helmet. This Scorpion is exactly what I wanted, and I'm really happy after using it for a few months now. For starters, it's genuinely waterproof and with last through a rainstorm. I havn't seen any water coming through the vents, visor interface, or modular flip-up interface.The quality is very good to me, better than my RS-1, better than my AGVs, and crazy good for this price point. The vents move well, the flip-down visor moves solidly, the flip-up front is secure and not flimsy, and feels rock-solid once it clicks into the main helmet.The visor works well, and is dark enough for me to ride during sunny days without issue. I wear glasses and there's plenty of room behind them. The visor ever-so-slightly hits the top of my nose at full extension, but it doesn't bother me.The fitment is a little tight, but that's normal for Scorpion helmets. My EXO-R2000 is the same way, so spring for the larger size if you're on the fence. Things are definitely snug if you have a microphone and speakers inside like I do, but I prefer snug. Overall I think this helmet fits intermediate heads very well. The liner feels pretty good, no complaints. It's not the softest like a Bell or Shoei, but it's not rough like the Icons or a cheaper helmet. Overall great.Airflow is lacking, but that comes with modular helmets. I can tell a difference with the bottom vent, but I honestly can't feel when the top one is open or closed. But if I'm riding in 95 degrees, honestly I'll grab a different lid. To that effect, I found this helmet to be pretty quiet. Not silent, but more quiet than most. But who cares, you should ride with plugs anyway!No buffeting as fell as I can tell, and the helmet feels very stable at speed. The visor is absolutely massive and gives me a better viewing angle than any other helmet I've worn. That being said, there is definitely some distortion at the top of the curve, so optically I give it a 4/5. Good not great.I took the dirt visor off immediately, so I can't comment on how that effects things.This does feel a little heavy, and my neck gets sore when using it on the sportbike after a while. But really not too bad. It's certainly lighter than other modulars though.My only complaint is the ratcheting system, as there's no \"traffic-mode\" level that barely cracks the visor open. The first level opens the shield pretty significantly, and that can be annoying around town when you still need airflow. Just a small complaint, but very evident in day-to-day riding.I use the Scala G9 headset and everything mounts and fits perfectly.All-around, with the sun visor and a modular face, this is one of the best featured helmets I've seen. It's my go-to helmet for commuting and touring now, and I love wearing it. And once you consider the price point, this is one of the best helmets on the market right now. And it looks sweet! I also contacted Revzilla and they said that a darkened visor is in the works and should be available shortly. Highly recommend.\n",

      "Great helmet, but...\n",
      "I have had the helmet now for a couple weeks. With a 23\" head the Large was just too tight (several pressure points that were uncomfortable) and so I upsized to the XL.  The XL is just barely a hair big, but it is still very snug and tight fitting as it should be.  The padding, functionality, face shield, drop down internal sun shield all function perfectly. I love the modular feature and the internal sun shield since I wear glasses.  The only negative is the vibration of the visor above 45 mph.  It is a very low-frequency vibration that I can't hear, but I can feel it in the helmet.  At 60+ mph it is unbearable for any ride over 30 mins (I commute 30 mins one way every day and have taken the visor off for my commute). It isn't buffeting because there is really no change when I stand above my windscreen. My head isn't even pulled around when looking to the side.  The visor works very well other than the very low vibration. My Fly helmet visor has a different noisy buzz that doesn't vibrate the helmet.  My Gmax helmet visor does get a little annoying with the visor on at 60+ mph. The single large vent on top of the helmet provides excellent ventilation, but it also, in turn, increases the noise level at higher speeds. If the helmet wasn't modular or didn't have the internal sun screen, I would return the helmet, but with these features, the hi-viz graphic design and the fit and finish, it is a great helmet that I will use on the road without the visor and offroad with the visor.\n",

      "This is a great helmet. Immediately on hitting speed (70)+, I smiled in wonder-no buffeting, quiet, terrific drop down sun shield, and a peak that didn't jerk my head around even when looking back to check traffic before changing lanes. It was 88 degrees, but the venting kept the helmet comfortable. I stopped for gas and sweated pretty hard while I filled my tank with the helmet off. When I put the helmet on and got to about  50 mph, the venting was s good that it was like a swamp cooler was blowing cooled air through the vents. And the neon green/black color pops. I'm sure I'm visible to drivers. So that's my story after the first 150 miles. I'm a believer, and recommend this helmet enthusiastically!\n",

      "Just what I was looking for...\n",
      "This is my first Scorpion helmet, but I have dozens of adventure helmets from other manufacturers.  Sizing is small, so order 1 size larger than you normally wear (I normally wear an XL in Bell and AFX, but I needed an XXL for this).  The fit is great with no hot spots.  The cheek pads are a little tight, but they do break in.  After 3 weeks, everything fits perfectly now.The visor is clear with no distortion, and the eye ports are quite wide.  I will no longer by a helmet that does not have a flip-down sun shield, and this one works effortlessly.  The peak is just big enough to block the sun if I put my head down a bit.  I get no buffeting with this helmet at all on any of my bikes - with and without windshields and fairings.Which brings me to the reason I bought this helmet.  It's QUIET!  I read some reviews that stated the opposite, but compared to any other helmet I own, this one is the quietest at speed.  I mounted my Sena 10S speakers inside (which is dirt-simple with the speaker wells molded into the liner), and no longer have to crank the volume to hear, nor yell to be heard.  People say it's like I'm standing beside them when I answer a call on my bike.I like that the helmet is modular, but to be honest, I probably will never open it up.  Airflow is just fine for me.  I never understood the need for all the vents in a helmet, but the ones in this helmet work just fine, even in 85-90 degree weather.  Better yet, when it's 40 degrees, they can be closed, and actually do block the cold air out.Quibbles?  Just a couple.  The visor can't be cracked open - it's either closed or opened about 1\".  In the morning at stop lights, I'd like to just crack the visor to keep it from fogging.  With this helmet, it opens a bit too much.  Also, the drop down sun shield could stand to be a couple shades darker.  That's it, and frankly I can live with both just fine.\n",

I ordered and 2XL and still a bit tight, I'm struggling to put on my prescription glasses with the helmet on, possibly because I'm fat. Noice level is tolerable in particular because my GS has the SC Project exhaust. Ventilation is ok, a few extra vents would be much appreciated. I fitted a SENA SMH10, I had to remove the inner guts of the helmet but is doable. Vision, I get some distortion when looking to the sides. The inner drop down dark shield is great and goes low enough to prevent many critters from flying in your face. The physical looks of the helmet is very aggressive and looks great. Weight is moderate. I'm am very happy with it and would highly recommend it.\n",

Noise was decent but I am one that does like to hear my bike some too. The drop down shade is great and optics are very clear with no distortion. I found the helmet warm with no fogging (we started out in mid 40's). Love the styling and looks, so far so good.\n",

I've found it to be very comfortable, after reading up on the fit I took a medium instead of a small and I'm happy with it the only negative point on it is the peak, it is a bit thin and flimsy, would be awesome if it was more ridged.

      "I've been using Shoei and Arai helmets for the last 25 years.  I've put 14k miles and 6 months of riding on this Scorpion helmet.- I did have to remove the visor for road riding.  -No other options good options for Modular adventure helmets with flip down sun shield.  There is the Schubert made ones, E1 and the Touratech but they both feel claustrophobic.- Sizing is similar to other MD helmets. Although I do need thicker cheek pads for it to fit my cheeks correctly.-I had to cut into the Styrofoam to fit the Sena speakers in the correct location and also so they weren't pressing on my ear.  The ear opening was a little too low and forward.Pros:-Fit and finish on this helmet is not too bad. -Visibility is excellent.  Very wide and tall view.  -Modular system works well.-Sun visor mechanism is smooth.-weight is fine. Other modular are usually heavier(but they have better materials)-replacement parts are cheap!Cons:-They didn't glue in the threaded visor, shield insert well so it constantly came out along with the screw when taking the visor off and on.-The drop down sun shield is way too light.  Had to add an additional strip of tint on the top of the clear shield for heading towards the sun.-It does not wrap around the bottom of the cheeks like more high end helmets do so doesn't feel as secure.-Fairly loud.  Both my Sena units are not loud enough to overcome wind noise so I have to wear earbuds.-Very flimsy with the face piece locked in the upward position. although it does make it easier to put on.  Just doesn't feel all that solid.-Ventilation is not that good.  Even in very cold weather it is hard to feel any air passing through the single top vent.-Shield gouges easily.  On my 3rd shield. and doesn't come with Pin-Lock standard nor is it pin-lock compatible out of the box.With all the gripes, I still like the helmet for its visibility and functionality.  Also, not much  else to compare it to yet.  Would buy again.\n",

The helmet itself is very confortable, obviously much more so than a Snell rated helmet. The ventilation is consistently good, the visor is really hard to fog (the inner tinted lens does fog a bit more easily).With the cutouts for BT speakers, it's as confortable as it's gonna get. There simply is no added pressure.The liner is good (not as good as something like the EXO-R200).You get a lot of peripheral vision, and the dropdown visor is great to avoid having to carry an aditional visor. The ability to take of the peak and use it for highway speeds is really good as well.Overall this helmet met and surpassed my expectations and is already my default go-to helmet for everyday use and the fact that it can be customized to serve the purpose of each trip just makes it even better!\n",

      "This review is taking into consideration riding in as many climates as it was possible to do in the last year or so that I've had it. In other words: 4 Season.Bought this at the start of last year's riding and after riding in it for over 7500 miles or so in everything from mid-thirties to triple digit I know whereof I speak. If you are willing to compromise a bit in just about everything you can quantify in a helmet, this helmet will deliver on more fronts than anything in it's price point.To start with, it doesn't do anything particularly well but it does most things adequately once you know how making it the literal \"Swiss Army knife \" of helmets. The beak is removable and even up over 80 does not threaten to rip my head off but YMMV. Front shield is removable and replaceable with a pinlock piece with great visibility. Additionally with the shield removed you can fit MX goggles if desired. Which leads to ventilation which can best be described as adequate. I roasted whenever the shield was fully sealed in anything over 80, the chin bar vent is especially weak. Top vent is adequate but what would really help would be some exit vents or side vents. Otherwise in the cold it's a bit drafty by the ears and the chin curtain is not very large but with proper speakers in and a balaclava it's pretty comfy even down into the 30s.Hardware is smooth and functional, opening and closing the chin bar is super easy even with the hugest of gloves on, same for the flip down visor on the left making those cool drive ups possible!In short for an \"adventure touring\" helmet this not only looks the part it IS the part. I get by far more comments on it then any other piece of gear I own and I'm always happy to share with others about my experiences with it.\n",

I've experienced all weather from ice and snow to extreme heat.The helmet has several features that are clearly very well thought out. I would recommend it to anyone as it has served me very well (especially for the price!)My only complaint (and I read another review here complaining of the same) is the visor fogs up terribly in wet or cold-and-wet conditions. I get lots of condensation on the inside of the visor and it is difficult to clear up once it has started. The front vent they have installed to help de-fog the visor does little to help. It is so bad that I've begun searching for another helmet to wear on long trips when I'm expecting anything but dry or warm conditions. If this helmet had a pinlock visor I'd have given it a glowing review!\n",

      "New to Full Face/Modular\n",
      "I have been a Harley Street Glide guy for 10yrs. Had a short windshield, went no-helmet when cruising. When heading to rallies through helmet states I went for the Harley brain buckets.  Then I got into Iron Butt rides. Moved to 3/4 helmet with sunglasses for day and safety glasses at night. Wanting to get into long distance enduro riding like an Alaskan trip or the Pan-American, I started learning about the 1200GS/A. I recently bought one. Anyone who has ever bought Harley gear knows you can't wear Harley gear with a BMW...and vice versa. So I'm starting over. I was worried about not getting the wind-in-my-face feeling, but I need comms and 24hr element protection. So I wanted a modular. The more I looked at the idea of off-road trail riding, I knew I wanted the ability of wearing goggles.  It was all a big risk because my wife has me on a clothing gear/farkle budget. The Revzilla video review and lengthy discussion on one of the Adventure Rider forums sealed the deal for me. Only a $290 gamble.Heres my initial take: - Looks awesome in person.- The hi-vis yellow is the right amount of graphics and function. Doesn't make me look a teenager with Ed Hardy style crap on my helmet. Looks clean and classic. - The peak is easy to change out, if I remember to carry a quarter with me.- The cheek padding is very snug. But everyone has told me that the forehead doesn't eventually give, but the cheek pads do, so don't get too worried over the tightness.- The visor is difficult to flip up while wearing winter gloves, but certainly not a quality issue, just nothing easy to grab.- The visor fogged immediately, and the chin vent doesn't \"work\" to de-fog very rapidly...You're better off cracking open the vent...See previous comment about difficulty. I need to go get some quality anti-fog and apply, or a pin-lock visor.- The modular chin release is a very easy motion and the chin bar in the up position feels very balanced.- The fit is really nice. That's not really saying much since the fit is really nice for my particular noggin. I'm on a roundish 58...bought the Medium.- Haven't bought comms yet, and I'm worried about the sound level of the earpieces being enough to overpower the 1200GS noise and wind. Mind you, it's not uncomfortable noise (without earplugs), it's just might be too loud to hear my music/audiobooks on long rides. With earplugs, I imagine it will be a quiet ride. But I don't want plugs if I have comms. We'll see.- All-in-all, this helmet is absolutely worth $290. Probably worth a couple hundred more. I'd recommend to anyone on a budget.\n",

      "Good do-it-all helmet, but not perfect\n",
      "Overall, I’d say I’m 85% pleased, as it does what it promises to do (mostly) for such a versatile lid. I’ve been riding in Northern California with it and it’s been quite rainy and morning commutes and backroads rides are in the 30’s, so this is a wet/cold review. PROS: Good build quality and comfort. Very easy to install Scala intercom and speakers. Dirt peak works well for sun blocking, internal flip-down tinted visor is fantastic, modular flip up works well. Super cool looking according to my friends and coworkers. Not too heavy, even then I’m out doing dirt/mud riding.CONS: The included air curtain doesn’t really work well when you flip up the modular often; it starts coming out. Clear main face-shield is NOT optically perfect; the area right in my primary line of sight is slightly distorted. The face shield doesn’t fog up, but it does condense some in cold/wet weather, so ultimately I still need to lift it occasionally to get it clear up. The main face-shield doesn’t keep the rain out perfectly when casually sealed; you have to very forcibly tighten the shield down to keep small beads of water coming in during heavy rain — note this latter issue may just be that water beads on the top seal of the shield but if you have to lift up the visor briefly to remove condensation, the water trickles into the interior. FINAL THOUGHTS: It’s actually quieter on my Tiger800xc than my Scorpion EXO T-1200 (surprising). It breaths a ton of air in through the underside to help reduce condensation, but even with the chin curtain installed lets in a ton cold air this time of year so a balaclava or turtleneck are a must — not uncommon for a dirt-inspired design.  Until I have some warmer weather I won’t know how it really breaths, but for the price, it’s a good do-it-all helmet. Hardly perfect, but good.\n",

      "Purchased this helmet several months ago with all new gear for my new bike (to me). Fresh bike, fresh gear, fresh start. Im well aware this helmet is marketed for the adventure crowd, but dang if it isnt an awesome street helmet as well. Because of its modular design and so many features, its super easy to configure to what you need, even mid-ride. For instance: ride to work/avg commuting= drop visor down, peak on to block sun in eyes heading east into sunrise and chin bar up for morning coffee/nicotine. Then, get off work: take peak off and chin bar down for better aero for a quick back road romp on the way home. Any situation, even on-road, it can handle.  Size: Ordered too large but was able to get inserts a smaller size that remedied the situation after return period expired. As others stated, can squeeze the cheeks a bit much when chin bar is down Aero: obviously peak on causes more buffeting, but have ridden 80+ with it on, minor bobble-heading. Peak off, only complaint is minor buffeting during head checks. Looks: many awesomes, much envy. Wow. Many ?'s about what it is and compliments and master chief references. Vision: No distortion, drop down visor often fogs before reg. visor does. Literally no frame in side periferees. The chin bar cut outs (making it look dirtbike helmetish) that the lens contours makes it great to look down at bar end mirrors without having to tilt your head down. Noise: loud-ish, but mostly because of modular design and possibly because of pad liner swap as mentioned previously. I often wear a balaclava under it which usually cancels out excessive noise well enough. Stop reading this and just buy it already, you wont regret it.\n",

      "I've had this helmet for  few months now and have logged thousands of miles in it and over all, I have to say it's a great helmet. Does it fit like my $600 Shoei? No, but for a sub-$300, it's wonderful and is plently comfortable. For only having one air vent up top, the air flow is good, but could be better. It keeps you cool enough in the summer time though.The optics are surprisingly clear for an inexpensive helmet and there is minimal distortion.It's loaded with features and everything works well. It's fairly noisy, but I wear earplugs most of the time, so this isn't an issue for me. My Sena installed easily and works well with this helmet.I have three complaints:First - The latch to lock the face of the helmet closed is a bit finicky and I find I have to slam it closed  pretty hard to get it to latch properly. My buddy has the exact same helmet and has the same issue. Not a deal breaker, but annoying nonetheless.Second - If it's cold/raining, this helmet is absolutely worthless. While the optics are good, the visor (and tinted drop-down visor) fog horribly and get substantial condensation on the inside. Worse than any other helmet I've had and enough to make me not wear this in bad conditions. It NEEDS a pinlock visor desperately.Third - The increments in which the visor opens are too large. You can't just crack the visor open a few millimeters to get extra airflow when it's hot. The least you can open it is about an inch, and that won't really do.All that being said, I would buy this again.\n",

      "Got this Helmet less than a month ago and love it.. fits well, not to noisy, has everything I wanted in a helmet at half the price that most in that category are.. love a modular helmet, don't have to take it off to show your face, (military bases) can change out the shield in a hurry if needed, (night to daylight) and the visor for off-road riding, tons of air flow.. Now the problem I have with this helmet is the face shield on and off.. I added a dark shield on the first ride I used it.. then came back and wanted to replace the shield with the clear one and add the visor on... nope... the right side screw will not come out.. just turns in place, I used a quarter to tighten it and then one to remove, well tried to anyway..For me that's a big deal.. back to the reasons I like this helmet, so now stuck with a non changeable face shield and no visor.. hoping it will get fixed/replaced by scorpion but will see I guess.. update to follow..\n",

      "I like modular helmets. I started with a Nolan N44 Trilogy and then upgraded to a Shoei Neotec that I REALLY like to the point that I never wear my half helmet ever on my Street Glide.I recently purchased a second bike, a 2015 Triumph Exlplorer, and wanted more of an ADV style helmet to go with it instead of my Neotec.The AT950 is certainly not a Neotec and it is about half the price, but is a a very good helmet. The fit and finish is excellent. The chinbar locks in bomber every time.The visor does vibrate at speed (you can look up and see it) but it's not annoying and I really can't feel it. The helmet is quieter than I ever expected and it does not require earplugs even at 80 mph.The ventilation is pretty good, but it's not air conditioning either. Personally, I am underwhelmed with the ventilation on every helmet I have ever tried. If you want air, ride with the visor up!The sun visor is good. There is a little distortion in it, but nothing I can't live with on a helmet at this price point. The sun visor IS NOT DARK ENOUGH. It needs to be a lot darker IMO. It's serviceable but I don't know why they didn't make it darker.I looked at pretty much every ADV helmet on the market (price not a factor), settled on this one and am very happy.\n",

The padding material feels so good and high quality, much better than my $650 SHOEI. Noise level is above average for a dual sport helmet due to the chin guard. I run motorcycle adventure tours in Colombia and it can get really hot sometimes that's why the flip up option is a must, also to be able to talk to my group without having to remove my helmet. The drop down tinted visor is also a must now, no more worrying about sunglasses while riding.

      "I was in the market for an adventure helmet to upgrade from my old HJC.  I was interested in some features like the drop down sun visor because I have broken a few sets of sunglasses at the arm where the pad pinches the side of your head.  The modular jaw is an added bonus.  For the price you cant beat the amount of things the helmet does, and does well.  The modular jaw is great for group riding, when your stopped you can yell some instructions and they will actually hear you!  The field of view from the visor is great and the shield is optically correct, with no fogging (i live in Canada, riding in the fall, you definitely test the anti-fog).  I almost bought the matte black version but decided to hold out for the Revzilla orange, and absolutely love it.  Nothing about the helmet feels cheap, and it is very comfortable out of the box.   The cheek pads are quite snug, but I popped them out and squeezed them down a bit and they are perfect.    I would buy this helmet again if it was lost or stolen, and from Revzilla too!  Living in Canada I am used to getting hosed with duties and shipping delays... this arrived at my door in 4 days for a great price.    If you're thinking about buying this one... DO IT.\n",

      "Most versatile helmet to come from Scorpion!\n",
      "I’ve been wearing Scorpion helmets and gear since 2005 or 2006 I can’t remember that well but I remember the quality of the helmet back then and for the price, it could not be beat!  Since then, I’ve bought so much Scorpion gear from helmets, to full race leathers.  The EXO-950AT in my opinion is the most versatile helmet on the market especially for the price!  Comparing to the only other real competition, the Schuberth, the Scorpion functions every bit as well as the Schuberth but with a much more reasonable price tag.    The only 2 reasons I gave the helmet a 4 out of 5 are 1: the “cut outs” for speakers inside the helmet are so shallow I found myself having to modify the speakers in order to make them fit.  (didn’t want to modify the helmet :p) and 2: The noise level it a tad high.  Not to the point where its intolerable but more so that it’s hard to hear the music on the speakers inside the helmet.  (I am using a UCLEAR HBC200 as a comm system).  As for the functions and features of the helmet, I found all of them to be better than anticipated.  The vision is so wide sometimes I forget my chin bar is down.  The anti-fog shields work great on both the shield and the drop down visor.  The flip up mechanism is quick and easy to use and a relief on hot days when stuck in traffic.  I did wish the beak was a tad longer to help block out the sun but that might have caused more of a chance to the wind to catch it and put un-necessary strain on your neck.All around would I recommend this helmet?  Absolutely!  Thank you Revzilla for the lightning fast shipping and the notification that the orange Neocon color was in stock ?.\n",

      "Wait for Sizing Refinements\n",
      "I own four motorcycles and numerous helmets that are all medium size (skid lids, Shoei, off road helmets and two Scorpion helmets). I am a fan of Scorpion helmets since I have worn a medium Scorpion EXO-900 for quite some time now and just completed a ride across the US while wearing the AT-900.  As a result, I ordered the EXO-AT950 helmet for on and off-road use. I believe that Scorpion is still working out some sizing issues with the AT-950 so you might want to wait until further refinements.  I recently ordered the EXO-AT950 in a medium size since my EXO-900 fits perfectly.  However, the AT-950 does not fit the same and I believe the company is working through some issues with this since I have read similar complaints in various rider forums.  The problem with the AT-950 is the compression placed on the jawline when the modular front is placed into the lowered position.  The helmet feels fine when the modular front is in the lifted position but drastically over compresses the jawline in the lowered position.  Based on a recommendation from a rider in an on-line  forum, I wrote Scorpion and they sent me the medium cheek pads for the AT-920 which also fit in the AT-950.  I told the representative at Scorpion that this would not fix the issue and I would need even smaller cheek pads.  They stated they only had the medium available for the AT-920 and that is what Scorpion sent me in the mail.  Scorpion also stated that other users have also commented on this and the company was looking into the issue. As I expected, the new cheek pads did not change the compression on the jawline so I will have to order the large cheek pads which are supposed to be smaller. I'm not sure that this will make a difference so I may be stuck with a helmet that does not fit properly.  Otherwise, the graphics and features of the helmet are great.  Too bad about the drastic over compression on the jawline.\n",

      "Not many modular helmets available with a visor right now just the Scorpion AT-EXO $300 and the Schubarth E1 $900. The price difference is MASSIVE and that alone kept me away from the Schubarth. The field of vision on this helmet is AWESOME!! I had a full face Icon before and it was heavy and loud and this one is light and much quieter. This modular helmet has it all and it all works very well. The vent are easy to reach and work well but there are only 2 and if there is a weak point on this helmet that may be it, but if you flip down the internal tinted visor and open the outer visor there is more than enough airflow so for me this is not an issue. This helmet gets lots of looks and attention because of its aggressive styling.  It looks really bad ass and lots of guys ask me about it. For $300 or so you can't go wrong with this bad boy!!\n",

      "I've been totally impressed with this helmet. So far probably 700-800 miles with it and can't come up with a gripe about it. I wanted to try a modular with a peak and drop down sun visor, two features I never had. The flip up is super convenient for getting a drink, taking pictures or just getting more air flow. I like the options with the drop down visor and a clear shield. Peak is pretty aerodynamic and comes off pretty easily with a coin. It is a bit quieter with it off on the highway. Fit is as good as my Arai XD4, in fact pretty much have shelved the xd4 for now. Noise is about the same and with ear plugs the thing is super quiet. Venting is not quite as good as the Xd4 but it's close and the chin vent is the best I've used. Fully open you get great air flow. Features, fit and material/build quality are much better than what you'd expect at the price. Would have considered the Schuberth but at $800, no thanks. You get way more than what you pay for with this Scorpion. Also my first Scorpion anything I've owned and I'm new fan.\n",

      "Exactly what I was looking for\n",
      "After taking a 3000 mile trip with my 1200GS and a street helmet, I had a list of things I wanted on my next lid. Adventure helmet was a must, just for ventilation off road and being able to throw goggles on. Comfort for tons of miles on the street. Some sort of sun protection without the need to throw sunglasses on. And in a perfect world, a modular that lets me eat and drink on the go. I didn't think that was all possible but once I saw the AT950 I knew I had to get it. Paired with my Sena 10C, it's a great all-arounder. I was even happy to see I could close the face shield with my goggles on, for a more quiet ride between trails. I've also been surprised to find it's the quietest lid I've ever owned. I can hear my Sena just fine and haven't had to put earplugs in for rides under 200 miles.So far, I've only found two downsides. Because it's modular, the visor can't attach to the helmet in the middle, so it has a minor vibration on the highway. This is fine for me for the most part but for long trips I'll probably take the peak off of for highway days, and put it back on for dirt days. And then second, the face shield is hard to get cleaned just because you can't just pop it off like most helmets. You have to take the screws out and the peak off. Which isn't horrible, just not as convenient as other helmets. You can still get the field of view clean, just not the sides.\n",

      "So far this helmet has been great. The strap is less convenient than my prior modular but more comfortable on the chin. It has been very hot lately and I get a lot of airflow with the tinted drop-down visor down and the outer face shield open, nice to have that option. The peak is effective at blocking the sun and seems to be aerodynamic. We have had some cool mornings with conditions that would normally cause fogging of my shield on my old helmet, I have had zero fog with the Scorpion. I have used Nolan helmets in the past and liked them but the Scorpion fits more like Shoei helmets I have had in the past. It has a snug fit around the face more like a full face helmet, and very comfortable with no pressure points. It's a keeper.\n",

      "Just What the Doctor Ordered\n",
      "I've been riding an large adventure bike for three years (25 on other bikes) and have longed for a modular adventure style helmet from the day I started riding an adventure bike (I had been using a LS-1 adventure helmet, which is ok, but not real comfortable, loud and too long of profile, which can be scary in a strong cross wind. Prior to that I had an early HJC modular, that was so wide, I felt like Jack from Jack in the Box). I was excited when Schubert/Touratech came out with their modular adventure helmet, because I knew someone would come out with a more affordable version. And I was right. When it was Scorpion, I was even more excited, because I have their Yukon jacket and pants and with the exception of a couple of nit-picks, have been extremely happy with the quality and function of the product, So I ordered the helmet and waited anxiously for it's arrival. When it arrived, I carefully examined the helmet with critical eyes, since this is a early production model and a new product. I couldn't find any flaws. The interior looked fairly plush and trying it on confirmed it. I have a fairly narrow face, so it was nice to have the check pads fit snuggly, but too snuggly, against my face.The aerodynamics of the helmet and visor were of concern to me, but the first time out revealed excellent wind isolation, with minimal buffeting (far better than either of my last two helmets). The visor is great. I've ridden twice with the helmet, the last ride was about 130 miles and with significant crosswinds for part of the ride. The helmet was very stable and with out the \"grabbing\" affect that my previous adventure helmet produced in strong crosswinds...nearly breaking my neck. I like the fact that I can remove the visor and convert it to a standard modular, should I decide to start riding a touring bike. The shield is optically very good, with a very wide view. It seals well, with no apparent wind leaks. Can't say about how well it will seal out rain...yet.I use a Sena communications device and had no problem installing is on this helmet. I appreciate the pockets for the speakers and found the position to be correct.I love the styling. I purchased the two-tone gray version. You should note that this is actually painted, not tape. I like it a lot.The air flow doesn't seem to be as good as it could be, but then I've had the wind skirt on for the first two rides. That said, I haven't had a sweaty head after riding in 95 degree weather (I wear a Nike Pro skull cap).If you're a hardcore adventure rider, this may not provide the best protection because of the modular design, but if you're like me and ride dirt roads occasionally, this is a great option.I feel that I got a great helmet for the money. In fact, I would be hard pressed to see how a Schubert/Touratech would be worth nearly $600 more.All in all, I love this helmet and look forward to many years riding with it.Revzilla - They can be summed up in two words: THE BEST\n",

I have a Schubert C3 Pro and love it but wanted an adventure helmet...so I pre-ordered the Scorpion EXO-AT 950. I figured \"Its coming from Revzilla, there isn't a better company to buy from EVER (best customer service, awesome Gear Geeks, reliable, just all around excellent), and it if sucks, I will return it.\"I got it 3 days ago and I am just impressed all around. It is very versatile, adapts into street, adventure, and mid range 'versions', it awesomely stylish, and really well thought out. I wear the 2XL and it is a bit tight in the cheeks but after removing the pads and 'standing on them', they fit great. The fit is a bit small, when compared to a Schuberth for sizing purposes.It is by far the best ventilated helmet I have ever worn. Super super airflow. At speed it is a bit loud but in dirt and around town it is fantastic. I give this product an A+ for the design, style, and value it delivers.\n",

      "This has become my go-to helmet.  I love the flip down goggle-visor.  It's sturdy enough to prevent my glasses from buffeting or to protect them when it rains.  The helmet is a nice weight and feels luxurious.\n",

      "It was great working with RevZilla. My son uses RevZilla and they did really goodbye him. I ordered a couple things from  RevZilla.  As far as the helmet they had a great selection. And the prices are average for online ordering.  Their customer service is way above average. The HJC helmet is real good for the price.\n",

      "This helmet sits very comfortably on my ample noggin, even when strapped extra snugly. The liner has always kept my head pretty dry even on really hot days. The weight is quite comfortable compared to any other helmet in the price range with the advantage of feeling very sturdy and well constructed above competing helmets. It looks great, which is always a bonus.\n",

      "This is a good short helmet. It is a little nosy  but not unbearable. I changed the pulldown shield to a clear shield. That way I can use sunglasses and if it gets too dark I can take them off and use the pulldown clear shield. Helmet is comfortable and doesn't get too hot.\n",

In addition to reducing sun glare, it functions well as additional eye and face protection in those unexpected situations when you find yourself behind a dump truck on the highway.\n",

But again, you get a good amount of padding and protection with this so it mAkes sense that it is on the thicker side. Perfect for the summer time, does ride up at high speed I found. The flick down visor is a good option but I have found myself not using it that much...\n",

      "I went from a true half helmet to this due to an age out on my old helmet. This is larger overall, but very comfortable. I wanted more protection, and the integrated drop down visor is by far the best feature. I live in Texas and this helmet is perfect for me and the conditions. Airflow is actually better than my old half helmet even though that had front and rear vents and this only has rear, the airflow dynamics must be better because I can feel the draw of the air through the helmet. Based on the first few hundred miles, I'll be buying this again and again.\n",

      "When I purchased this law-required lid, I already had a modular and a half-helmet. But the modular is too hot during the Sacramento Valley summer (this year the 100' temps lasted for weeks!) and has a tendency to fog when its cooler. I really like the half-shell but because I wear glasses, I require a drop down lens. The half-shell has that, but it's a dark tinted lens and my glasses already have transitions that darken in sunlight. Between the two darkened lenses, well... it was \"really\" dark. This 3/4 helmet has a feel similar to the half-shell and a near-clear drop down lens as well. It fits well, though it is really on the loud side. As to the protection it provides...I'm in no hurry to discover that quality in the helmet.\n",

      "spot on 3\n",
      "just ridden 3625 miles in 10 days wearing the helmet from new.It was worn in screaming hot weather , sunlight and humidity and puring rain of the cats and dogs variety .The helmet comes with a light tinted visor (although you can purchase the usually heavy tint , yellow and clear for about $25 each, however, the tint gave enough protection in bright sunlight , but was clear enough to be riddent in night conditions where as other riders were needeing to chnage glasses or goggles or shields  when we had to unfortunately ride on that little longer.Im a 60 size, on trying the 59-60 found it to be extremely tight fitting , and did not think it would settle down enough to make the helmet fit acceptable so went for the 61-62 . After a few days the of riding (7 hrs each) the helmet did relax, but not excessivly so,  it was secure on my head , with very minimal movement. So its possible the 59-60 would have also relaxed but the discomfort experienced would have made it distracting to unbearable over the settle in period.The helmet was experienced to be fairly warm in VERY hot sunlight, the rear vents dont seem to be really  100% efficient at moving air using only  a venturi effect, a RAM air system would have maybe been a better design factor.In conclusion, is this helmet a good item to have spent the money on,  you bet it is , the visor is just great, the fit settles quickly , Thermal qualities , a little warm in extreme heat and sunlight but not of any specific distraction. Very minor personal niggle for me is the double D ring system,  this is my favoured securing system, but always have a small tab on the external D ring to pull on the align the rings when securing the helmet strap, this means the rings over center on occasion whilst trying to fit the helmet , (for me ) .So if you are in the market for a good value and effective helmet , you could do so much worse than buying one of these.\n",

Not dark enough for full on sunlight, but it does take the edge off. I wear contact lenses so adding sunglasses is no problem, my wife has prescription lenses, so this helmet with the drop down visor is perfect for her. We tried on a couple at a motorcycle shop near us to make sure we ordered the correct size, but the delivered product was spot on. No complaints at all. Would definitely recommend this product and this vendor. Again the exceeded expectations and the helmets are perfect.\n",

      "First of all hats, or in this case, helmets off to Revzilla for freakishly fast shipping.  I ordered this helmet on a Monday AFTERNOON and it was at my front door Wednesday NOON.  Not real sure how they got it to my house in central MS so fast, but they are fantastic with the shipping.                                                                                Looked at and compared about four other helmets plus around three or four more on the HD web site.  Read a ton of reviews, asked the geeks at Revzilla a few questions and finally decided to give this one a shot.  I use to ride a Harley Sportster and have always worn a full or modular style helmet, but after an altercation with a curve, a ditch, and two weeks later a new knee, I took everyone's advice and got training wheels, or the next best thing, a Trike.  Yea, I know what you are thinking, the same thing I was thinking, but the wife is happy and comfortable and safe and that is all that matters.  So I figured that since I am basically driving a convertible Smart car, why do I need a 3lb-13oz bowling ball sitting on top of my head.  Although I like the headset and mic. it is not necessary with the sound system that is on this bike.                                           So, the HJC IS-Cruiser Helmet is fantastic.  Not a problem with the quality, everything was fit and finished.  When I looked in the mirror it looked a giant mushroom but once you pull the chin strap down and step away from the mirror it looks great.  I can't believe how light this thing is and the ability to see pretty much all around me is something I've never experienced on a bike.  It is almost like wearing a ball cap on the bike, got it out on the highway at 80 and it did not budge.  Granted the Trike blocks the wind pretty good but I stuck my head over the top and off to both sides just trying to see if it would move and it stayed in place.  At 80 it rode fine on the noggin with the sun shield up and with it down.  Looking forward to making a 12 hour trip to Daytona Beach in a few weeks with a much lighter skid lid.  Thanks Revzilla.\n",

I have a big melon and the 2X in HJC fits like it was molded for me.My only complaint is that the chin strap is too short. I can put it on, but it's a struggle -- something my old ones never had a problem with. I'll probably put a quick-release conversion on it to make it easier to use.

The fit is exact and the finish is great.Comfortable to wear. Not too hot. The venturi vent at the back seems to help. I rode 6 hours straight to Daytona Beach in 80 degree weather and I was comfortable the whole time.The strap fits perfect and is not too high or too low.The HJC logo is smoked and not very noticeable. It looks great.I still get a little bit of a mushroom look, but less than other helmets. the side and rear protection feels like a full face helmet almost. I'm happy I got this.The only CON: with the visor down, the optics are not perfect.

I have already used this helmet in temperatures ranging from the 50s to the mid 80s and found the airflow adequate to keep me comfortable in that entire range. The visor has 3 positions and was very useful. I plan on also trying the clear visor to determine what better fits my riding style.

      "Replacing an aged Schuberth modular helmet with a solid white GT-Air II.Installed Sena SR2 and included Pinlock visor and rode 2200 highway miles in four days with the new setup. These are my initial thoughts:Integrated audio fits very well and helmet is quiet enough that everyone I speak with on the phone has no idea I was going freeway speeds (on my K1200LT with windscreen up or down.)Airflow is decent, but commensurate with increased wind noise when vents are open.The breath guard wasn't highly functional, but the pinlock screen obviated that deficiency.I shouldn't have set my expectations as high after hearing about how quiet this helmet was supposed to be. I was slightly disappointed because there was wind noise, but this was probably only because my expectations were too high and unrealistic (and I rode fast...) . Note that I found that wind noise was least when I tilted my head up a bit from *my* neutral (i.e. natural) head angle- regardless of having the bike's windscreen up or down. Unfortunately, it was not a natural head angle for me.I purchased a snug fit (size Large) and sliding the helmet on and off was a bit uncomfortable on the tops of my ears, and it took a while to get used to the snug cheek pads (but this fit was relative to my worn out Schuberth, and of course head shape is a factor too.) I'm hoping the cheek pads will conform a bit to my face, but perhaps this is wishful thinking given that helmet pads shouldn't lose their integrity. Other than the snug cheeks, the helmet felt very good and comformtable for hours of tank-to-tank uninterrupted ridingHelmet didn't seem heavy at all to me, but I have a sturdy neck :)Integrated sun visor is relatively clear and easy to operate. I had no problems with visibility/view.Ratchet buckle is easy for me to use.The styling seemed a bit aggressive and stormtrooperish  in white, but I've warmed up to it.Overall, I am satisfied, and will likely enjoy this helmet until newer/better integrated communication technology is available.\n",

      "Great Features and Integrated SRL2 comm\n",
      "I am a Large on the RF-1100 (which I had for over 6 years) and this fits perfect. I needed to replace my old helmet and this was the perfect helmet. I tried on others like Arai but I felt this helmet had more features. The helmet is pricey though. I was thinking twice about it and reading many reviews but I rather spend more money on a helmet that is known for premium helmets with comfort. I do a lot of commuting and highway riding. From RF-1100 to GT-Air 2, I couldn't be more happy with the purchase. I like the latch system, very easy to latch on and off. I like the longer inside visor. I attached the pin-lock because I do get fogged up. I haven't had fog build up yet. Only my glasses get fogged up. I have ridden at night and there are distortions with the pin-lock installed. Not too bad where you can't see though. Air flow is ok. I think my hair blocks the vents on top of the helmet. I also got the SRL2 Comms. I like how everything is integrated. It's just a typical comms. Nothing special there. I just like how everything flows and nothing is sticking out. Personally, it's overpriced. Price for both helmet and comm is about over $900, which is insane. If they lowered both by $100 it would be perfect. Pros- Integrated bluetooth comms- inside drop down visor- latch chin system- Great styleCons- Air flow- Avg noise level- Pricey- Speakers placement could be better\n",

      "If you're looking at this helmet, you should be looking for something that is as quiet as possible with great aerodynamics. Let's face it, quiet also equals stuffy. The two vents actually flow pretty well when you're moving even at slow speeds. If you ride a lot of stop and go city traffic in hot weather, this is going to make you sweat and you may want to consider the modular. I commute with my R1 and most of the commute is interstate and this helmet is by far and above better than any helmet I've used yet to date. The vents operate easily even with crappy winter gloves.At highway speed the aerodynamics are just awesome and the helmet is so quiet I can have a phone conversation at highway speeds easily. I got the sena because I wanted the waterproofing and integration. People had complained about the sound quality with the first generation. I didn't have a first generation so I can't compare. However, I wear ear plugs (because of the exhaust on my R1) and I can hear the music and phone calls with no distortion. This being said, the speakers WILL distort when turned all the way up, but there's no need to do that. Pinlock visor - this thing is awesome. This is my first pinlock and it keeps visor from fogging in literally ANY condition. It gives a warning not to use the pinlock at night but who is going to pull that out? I've used it at night a lot and have had zero issues. Taking the helmet on and off to see what they were referring to with the light transmission failed as well. I can't notice a difference even at low light like dusk or dawn. It does not make it noticeably darker. I'm assuming this is just a cover their ass type of thing or something.I have one small complaint about this helmet... I can see the top of the helmet in full tuck. So, I get that this isn't meant to be on the racetrack, but they DID increase the field of view like 30 degrees or something like that. I wish they'd have made it 35. I ride like an idiot most of the time I'm in full tuck, and while this helmet has a MUCH better angle than my old helmet, I was hoping with the increase in angle at the top of visor would have eliminated this issue and although it's way better, it's still there. It's not much, so I gave the helmet high reviews because of how much an improvement it is and I also I know most people aren't riding on R1 in full tuck with this thing, so I'll give them that. Please keep in mind that I can only barely see the lining on the helmet. It doesn't bother me at all, but just something to mention. Other than that, this is one awesome helmet.\n",

I've had an HJC and an Icon before, and my Icon was 1/3 the price but had much much better airflow and less noise.  In the Shoei I'm going 30 and it's still a huge amount of wind noise.  Not to mention absolutely zero air flow unless you're going 50+.  The ease of installing a bluetooth headset is great, and so are the drop down sunglasses, but that's about it.  I've tried every combination of open/closed vents and swapping out the chin straps, but the noise levels and airflow are still atrocious.\n",

      "My First Shoei\n",
      "I got into riding about 5 years ago.  My first helmet was a cheap one from a \"big box\" store, and it was junk.  Upgraded to a 3/4 helmet, but eventually became convinced that a full face was better for safety.  Got an LS2, and it was OK, but at highway speeds with the vents open it whistled A LOT (there was one position you could put it in where it didn't whistle, but keeping it there was uncomfortable).  In addition, there was a lot of buffeting.  After reading reviews for years, I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a Shoei, the most expensive helmet that I've personally purchased.  It has not disappointed, even in the few times that I've ridden with it.  In my opinion, it is not as quiet as I had expected (based on watching many YouTube videos and comments on the previous Shoei Air), but the wind turbulence noise is consistent and easily dampened by ear plugs (whereas with the LS2, the whistling was very evident even with ear plugs). Its anti-fogging capabilities are also very good.  It is also very comfortable and has good wind flow through the helmet.  One of the best features is how aerodynamic the helmet is for me.  I have a cruiser with no wind protection, and the buffeting is very minimal, if not non-existent.  The helmet seems to cut through the air with ease.  With the shield partially raised, the airflow is incredible (of course, the instruction manual tells you not to do this at high speeds; haven't caught a bug, yet.)Overall, you definitely get what you pay for.  I would highly recommend it.\n",

      "Great quality and finish, many nice features\n",
      "This is my first Shoei helmet, I am impressed with the quality and finish, and also the features and design.  My previous helmet was a sport style helmet, which came down about a half inch longer around the neck area.  When I first put the Shoei on, I was a little surprised because it doesn't come down as far.  A half inch doesn’t sound like much, but it is definitely noticeable, and there’s a more exposed feeling as a result.  I’m not saying this is bad, I just different than my expectations, so I am getting used to that. Some people may prefer it, especially if coming from a 3/4 or half helmet.I prefer full face helmets for safety.  I was considering a modular because they usually have integrated sun shields, but modulars aren't as safe as full face.  So when I saw this Shoei with the sun shield I jumped on it.  The mechanism to raise and lower it is easy to use, and the shield stays where you put it.  I knew this helmet supports a pinlock shield, but I didn’t realize it was included, which was a very pleasant surprise.I always ride with foam ear plugs, so I can’t rate the noise level of this helmet.  This helmet has been designed to accommodate a Sena comm system, but I don’t plan to use this.The only comfort issue I have is with the micro ratchet, there's a piece of rubber that touches under the chin.  When looking down (a must on my bike in order to see the gauges) I feel it squeezed between my neck and chin, more so than double-D style straps.  I'm pretty sure this will be something I can get used to.  The micro ratchet itself is much easier to use than double-D.A new helmet is like a new pair of shoes that need to be broken in and gotten used to.  I hope I adjust to the GT Air II, because I really like it so far.\n",

The drop down visor is not only a nice feature but the cable system that it functions off of has never had an issue in the 4 years of owning it. Not having to swap out visors is such a nice feature but even nicer has been the fact that when it’s time to replace the main visor, the internal drop down has never needed to be replaced. I’ve considered more expensive helmets with an external tinted visor that drops over the main but I figured I’d end up having to replace both when the time came. The cost wasn’t worth it to me. The fit and comfort of the helmet has always been great. It fits a little bit bigger, externally, than other helmets I’ve had but it’s understandable considering the internal drop down visor. If you can swing it, a shell smaller than you would normally but with thinner foam inserts might help accommodate if it’s an issue. The chin vent does an excellent job of directing airflow up into the visor to clear any fog if you’re not using the pinlock that it comes with. All in all, great piece of gear. Sad to see it go for what Shoei is replacing it with...\n",

      "This is my 2nd shoei helmet. The 1st one i owned is RF-1100 Elektron TC-5 with Snell & DOT approved. Really great helmet, and it worth it every pennies no doubt about. Quiet helmet at high speed. But this GT Air is only DOT approved... o well, i still totally love it. The matte colors is solid. The internal sun visor is a plus. The pinlock anti fog insert lens is also included best in winter. Totally one stop shop and big savings. Low price & optional Affirm!!! Im inlove.\n",

      "I have tried to like this helmet but after nearly 2 years, I’ve given up.First off, the noise is unbearable. I’ve worn it riding all different types of bikes and no matter what, it is super loud. I can’t hear my Sena’s music on full volume. You must wear earplugs with this helmet. You will deaf after 50 miles otherwise.Second is the size/shape. I have other full face helmets that cost a fraction and they seem to be 3/4 of the size. You get the full bobble head look with this helmet. Also, something about the helmet shape leads to much more buffeting that with my other helmets (on the same bikes).The drop down sun visor is nice with zero distortion (I can’t say that for my wife’s Schuberth C3 Pro).The airflow is okay, but nothing life changing. I still recommend Shoei mainly because of their helmet inspection service. I loaned this to a friend who did me the favor of dropping it. I shipped it to Shoei and they performed a free inspection. That was pretty awesome.I’d recommend the RF-1200 over this helmet. Better looking and same Shoei quality.\n",

      "Had a mid $200's helmet this replaced. Wasn't sure of a significant difference between helmets in that price range and higher end helmets like the GT Air. I was wrong. The wind and road noise level in comparison to my scorpion exo and the GT Air Pendulum is night and day. Best way to describe it is, scorpion at 80 mph sounds like I'm sitting next to a moving train, the GT Air is like road noise in a Mercedes. The fit is snug yet comfortable like it should be. The only issue I've had with the helmet is the visor lock that seals it. It takes a little more effort than I feel it should, but it maybe due to a break in period. The visor is difficult to lock closed on the fly as it often requires to hands to do so.Time will tell. The pin lock visor is a wonderful addition. I've had the main visor fog all around the pin lock visor, but the pin lock visor never fogs keeping my field of vision clear on cooler days. You wont regret buying this helmet.

I also really like the ease of the internal visor.  The materials inside and out are also good quality.  The only nitpick I have is that with all vents wide open, airflow is barely perceptible--ironic considering its name is \"GT-Air\" huh?  I like the helmet overall as it is an upgrade to my old scorpion R410, but I think I'll be pulling the chin skirt out when the weather gets warmer here in Washington and pray for some additional air.  Otherwise, not a helmet I would pay MSRP for by a long shot.  With the upgraded materials and additional features compared to my old R410, I would say it is par for feature/price value at the closeout price, but the R410's airflow was leagues ahead of this Shoei's.  I'm hoping the GT-Air2 has better airflow.\n",

I’m used to that anyway. Second, the cheek pads are tight. race fit tight. (I’ve got big hog jaws for cheeks so this is probably me and not the helmet.

Other reviews noted this is common and said it would loosen up. Within a couple rides to work and back, the helmet did loosen up and has a great fit and comfort to it now. The view to the sides is not hampered at all, and I have no problem putting my glasses on once I have the helmet on. I wear Sonic Defender ear plugs under the helmet and there is no problems with that. The flip down tinted interior visor is great and comes in handy when driving into the sun.

If it gets too warm at a stop (and it will here in cali )  its easy to pop it open partially at slow speeds or full open at stops.  Winter im going to have to try the inti fog pice cause i can fog it up easily w/o it.   So ill touch on that later if it lets me here. Super light compared to my last one as well.  Although the cheek pad seems a lil too thick ill have to order or request the next size down for a feel on that.

Perfect for riding 60 degrees or below but when I took it out on an 80 degree day I nearly suffocated.  It has the least air flow of any helmet I have owned and at its price point I sadly have to say that I regret my decision to purchase it. Shoei is a great brand and make very comfortable helmets but nothing is comfortable with little to no airflow unless the temps are low.\n",

      "Loving the Helmet So Far\n",
      "I was in the market for a new helmet. My old Shoei X11 was worn out and had started to loosen up on me. When I first bought it, it was so tight I could only wear it for about 20 minutes at a time.I looked at several helmets and it came down to the RF-1200, and the GT-Air. I had RevZilla send me both and I tried them both out.The RF-1200 was a little more comfortable right out of the box. The GT-Air was more snug, but no hot-spots. This reminded me of my X11 and I figured once I broke it in that it would fit just right.The RF-1200 is smaller and lighter, but in the end, I went with the GT-Air. I really like the idea of the built-in sun visor. I have swapped face shields, worn sunglasses, you name it, for years. Having the convenience of the sun visor is what sold it for me. Besides, by the time you add another face shield to the RF-1200 you are in the same price range.Now, I’ve only got about 100 miles in on the helmet, but it’s been breaking in nicely. No hot spots and while it’s still very snug to get off and on it’s getting quite comfortable to wear for long stretches. Airflow is pretty good, but not as good as my old X11. Part of that is due to my X11 having excellent ventilation. Part of that is due to my X11 just not fitting as snug anymore. And, part of that is due to the built-in sun visor.I wear earplugs when I ride, and the noise level is acceptable. It’s quiet when you put it on, and doesn’t pick up much wind noise, but I’m not sure I’ve ever worn a helmet that wasn’t somewhat noisy, though I would say it’s quieter than my X11. I’m now thinking about getting a Sena as I can’t seem to get the helmet on/off with my current earphones (earplugs are not a problem).Over-all would recommend. Just keep in mind that the helmet is not SNELL rated so you may not be able to wear it on a track.\n",

The quality of the helmet is just not there. I'm not terribly rough on my helmets but I don't treat it like a glass vase either. Since May I've had to replace the goggle straps, super glue the goggle whining back to the goggles. I've also had the plastic pins that hold the goggle straps to the helmet pop out on two occasions, luckily I was not riding at the time. The top vent slider snapped off one day when I set the helmet down. Two of the plastic locks on the circular shark sides have broken on the right side of my helmet.this is a beautiful helmet and if the quality was slightly higher I would highly recommend it. I would have paid an extra hundred dollars to prevent these minor inconveniences.\n",

      "(Shark) Raw after 3 years\n",
      "Bought this helmet in 2015 when it was still called the Raw. Bought it for looks, and looks were basically all I got. Initially it was OK, but over time some problems started developing.CONS:-- Straps became worn and torn easily. Avoid moving the goggles too much as they end up becoming loose, and going above 60-80kmph the goggles begin to shake. This is relatively a quick fix by adjusting the strap tightness, but you can only go so far (3 settings). The wear is very noticeable, akin to wool.-- Aerodynamics are incredibly bad. Again going above 60-80kmph forces your head back by the wind with lots of force, any highway ride lasting longer than 15 minutes will hurt your back and neck. It is also very loud. Can't hear anything except wind.-- Vision is slightly limited compared to other helmets.PRO:-- Relatively lightweight-- Easy mobility (non-restricting neck movement)-- Looks cool-- \"Does the job\"Summary:If you want this purely for the novelty look, get it while expecting the worst for comfort and functionality. Those of you wanting to spend the money on a primary helmet, I would suggest getting a different helmet that is more comfortable and higher quality. If you like the look, Shark produces higher-tiered helmets that may resolve these issues, but be cautious of this particular item because it really is just for the look. I've lasted 3 years on this thing and I've been looking forward to getting a new helmet since the first season. If you wear this every day, you may grow tired of the look that you fell in love with in the beginning.\n",

Dislikes and my biggest issue with the helmet and why I will be buying a new helmet is when riding at speeds above 50MPH and doing a head check the mask lifts off your face and it's very unnerving. Under highways speeds GREAT helmet. But I commute everyday and put a lot of highway miles on and this helmet just isn't cutting it. Hope my review helps you make an informed decision.\n",

      "First off, I've been riding for over 25 years, and I've had every fast Super Sport bike, Harley, and helmet that there is. I thought that this helmet would solve a lot of problems by the closing the gap between a full-face and half helmet, but it only \"kind of\" does that.PRO's: Fit is great (for me), quality is top notch and on par with a high-end full face, and the style is very cool, it's quiet, it's Bluetooth ready.CON's: The goggles are proprietary so you have to use the ones that come with the helmet. The goggles claim to have Carl Zeiss designed lens's, and if they do, then Carl Zeiss stinks. My lens has an imperfection cast into it, and the manufacturer will not respond. Plus, the manufacturer is in France... so even though the helmet is brand new, the warranty is useless. Now I have to replace the lens myself, and since it's a unique goggle, finding one that fits it is difficult and expensive.The face shield has holes in it (I guess for speech?), so if you do cold weather riding, your face gets cold!There's no easy way to remove anything on this helmet, so cleaning the guard or goggles requires time and tedious tasks that must be done exactly.Conclusion: I love the helmet, but its a novelty at best. I bought it for riding the colder months, but the holes in the guard had me freezing on just a cool fall day!\n",

      "Perfect Helmet To Me\n",
      "Before I bought this helmet I read so many reviews, despite all the negative I ordered anyway. So here is my 2 cents on this helmet.It fits excellent, snug but not overdoing it very comfortable. The goggles are impossible to fog up, the mouth guard portion provides excellent airflow in and out, it will in no way protect you though. You can get the helmet on if you wear glasses, as I do takes a bit of practice but once you get it there is no issue there. However taking it off I have to take my glasses off first. If you wear glasses you have to position the facemask/goggles so it doesn't push your frame into your nose also but its just practice and getting used to it. Noise level is rough at higher speeds, I recommend ear plugs for long commutes, city its perfect to me, I like to be able to hear around me. People said the foam on the goggles was cheap and would wear away over time, Its the same foam pretty much that's on any goggles and I use it every day taking them on and off and I have no problems as of yet. This is a good helmet, its pretty much a 3/4 helmet so your face is vulnerable. It looks good of course, unique. People are not happy unless they have something to complain about, so pass up all those negative reviews and give this a shot if you like it.Chris\n",

      "If you like the style then this is a great helmet.As someone with a pretty large head, this helmet is awesome. It fits well and is super comfortable. Since I do a decent amount of riding at night I had to switch out the smoke lenses that come with the helmet for clear lenses (sold separately). But once I made that switch, I could see perfectly. The goggles fit great over my glasses and keeps them in place as well. It is a bit loud while riding but it's an open face so you're going to get the noise and airflow. Undoing the goggle/mask setup is super annoying so I usually keep it on.\n",

      "I upgraded from a bell custom 500 open face to the Shark Raw, at over 2x the price of the bell I was upgrading from and not being able to try and do a fit test or find a distributor to just hold it in my hand and try it on I was nervous. I measured my head at 57 1/2 cm and ordered the medium. I have been very happy with everything about this helmet since it arrived over 3 months ago and more than 2k miles of riding with it. Swapping lenses the first couple times is a pain and takes several minutes. I have learned how to don the helmet with the goggles and mask down. The vent on the helmet barely makes a difference although i have long hair. Padding, support and comfort are all there and has the space for BT speakers. It's lightweight. It's stylish. It has replaceable parts and good lenses. Keep your microfiber cloth on hand. I add a drop of water and chip off the bug guts and polish the lenses many times a ride the lenses are holding up well. Everything is as expected and I am still very pleased with this gnarly helmet. I'd buy it again. I have no plans for another upgrade. If something goes on it i can just replace that part and Zilla is quick at getting things shipped so i have confidence in keeping this around for a long time.\n",

      "I loved this helmet the first season I had it, light weight for a helmet in it's price range, a ton of air flow for hot summer days and the style is great!One big flaw, they choose to save a $1 on the goggle bracket, they are cheap cheap cheap.On a second season ride one of my goggle brackets broke mid turn on a rainy day causing me to low side my new Super Duke 1290 (only 900 miles on it) and miss a week of work. DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAPLY MADE HELMET! With out warming the whole face piece including goggles popped off, turning my visibility to zero in the rain. Hopefully the next rev replaces the cheap plastic goggle bracket with a metal bracket, would probably save a life or two for all of a $1.Attached was my quick fix picture-wire bracket, someone passing by was nice enough to go to the hardware store and help me get home.\n",

      "I was really excited about this helmet. It had the look I was going for, was not flashy at all etc. Liked the idea of the high quality goggles made for it, and was not worried about the mask as I was not intending to use it. First off, the fit is extremely snug on the ears. After 1 hour usage, my ears are literally in pain. The vent on top of the helmet rattles incessantly while riding when in the open position. It literally sounds like someone is tapping you on top of the head while riding. Getting the goggles on and off is an absolute pain. Why they didn't use a simple d ring, I will never understand. For the price I paid I expected a great deal more from this helmet. Now its used and I will be lucky to get 1/3 of what I paid for it. Extremely disappointed.\n",

      "Protection and durability: What's there to say about this helmet. It's open faced with a little extra plastic in areas that most helmets of this type don't cover. If you go down, the upper portion of your head should fair nicely, but don't expect the road to do any favors for your chin. It will keep the bugs out of your teeth though, which is certainly a plus for those vegan riders out there.My gripes in durability come mostly from the straps and the clips you have to attach them to the goggles with. These are rather flimsy and the entire five minutes or so I spent trying to connect the goggles to said straps was also spent worrying that I was going to break them. I've yet to have any problems beyond that, though I've only gone about 100 miles or so.Price: ... I wouldn't mind seeing it $50 lower in this department. The helmet is certainly nice and fits well, but given the quality of the goggles and plate, it seems just a tad too high. Style points boost the price.Comfort: The Raw certainly shines in this department, at least for short rides. It breathes more than well enough to keep you from sweating and fits quite nicely, remaining far less restricting than full faced helmets and the like. I did notice after about 50 miles or so though that the goggles were beginning to push on my face in a slightly uncomfortable way. I believe keeping your speeds down will likely prevent this, though for now, I'd simply say this helmet is meant for shorter rides, or ones involving more frequent stops.Air flow: It's almost like you're wearing nothing at all~ Really though, what else would you expect? This helmet doesn't do much to cut down the wind, and you're going to be keeping your face plenty cool whilst wearing it. Even with the top vent closed, there's more than enough air flow to keep even a Floridian happy. Don't expect to be doing any voiceovers while wearing this thing though. Even at low speeds, everything you say will be ten miles behind you by the time it leaves your mouth. Definitely not a helmet for motologs or the GoPro enthusiasts out there. Did I mention this is definitely a warm weather helmet? Yes? Then don't take it out riding on cold days... unless you like the cold, then by all means, do your thing.P.S. Keeping your speed below 60 or so keeps the noise level down fairly low. Once you go above that, you'd better have earplugs or enjoy the sound of your bike and the wind rushing past or you're going to have a bad time.Style: There's no doubt that this is where the designers wanted to place their cards with this helmet. It's small, sleek and sexy and I've little doubt it will turn a few heads. While the goggles and the guard that attaches to them might not be the most durable, they certainly add something to a type of helmet that usually just exudes a tired, old design. If you're looking for a street helmet and something out of the ordinary that won't leave your wallet in tears and looks good at the same time, this is definitely a product to order.\n",

      "First - Revzilla was very helpful as I was attempting to get a proper fit. Thanks guys! Size XL was the winner and feels great. The goggles feel great and the tint is just right for me on sunny or cloudy days. I've not yet tried them at night. Putting on the face protector was a bit worrisome. The little rubber pins that connect it to the goggles really need a bit of pressure to make them lock up and stay put. I'm never going to take the face protector off as these rubber pins seem to me to be a weak point. I've read other reviews saying the side plates are fragile. I see where they could break if not given a gentle hand. I have had them off several times without incident. Just something to consider. Overall, I'm very happy with the Shark Raw and with Revzilla. If you want a great looking helmet that gives you a great deal of anonymity while riding, this is a fantastic choice! Ride safe - Bugs wash off. Suv's don't . . .\n",

When the guy in the video pops off the side plates to take the goggles off you can see he is not able to put them back on the way they came off. I thought oh OK maybe he didn't try hard enough. WRONG! I ended up having the same exact problem. I mean this is a 300 dollar helmet I would like it to function flawlessly. I love this helmet I would recommend it to others.

      "Just What I Was Looking For\n",
      "Was looking for a unique, full-face helmet that would compliment my 09 Vegas 8-Ball, and found it with this beauty.It's not a legitimate full-face helmet, as the mouthpiece is just rubber and can be folded upward out of the way. If you're looking for legitimate full-face protection in the event of a wreck, this helmet won't suffice. However, it does a great job in protecting my face from wind, bugs, and small debris, and also has a slick look. I personally don't like the big-ness and bulky-ness of cruiser style full face helmets, and sport/dirt style helmets don't really go with my style, so this helmet fit the bill. If that sounds like you, go for it.It's a bit loud, but I knew that going in, and it doesn't bother me. It's also lightweight but durable, I dig that. It's very comfortable as well, thick, lush padding in both the helmet and goggles, and the mouthpiece doesn't actually make significant contact to your skin, so there's no discomfort there.I got the flat black, it looks killer. Size medium fits perfect, as I wear a 7 1/8 \" fitted hat.Great buy.\n",

It has an integrated slide to open/close instead of the plug. The only knock I would have against this helmet is price, but I knew the cost going in. If you like the look, order now.\n",

      "I really wanted to love this helmet. Really. I think it is the most badass looking helmet on the market....but that is where the praise ends.The system used to fasten the goggles to the helmet is cheap, and within one hour had already malfunctioned on my helmet. The pin that slides into the strap end to secure the strap to the goggle is easily pulled through the faster, and is a royal pain to replace. The goggles themselves are great, but do not fit flush or provide a good seal against the face due to the positioning on the helmet. The face mask attachment is a design flaw that will prove to fail in short order. As others have said, the helmet is very loud. This helmet looks great, and may be adequate for those on a low budget. If you want a real helmet that will be durable, comfortable, and not prone to failure, there are many other much better choices out there. I am sorry I wasted my money on this helmet...but it does look so cool!\n",

      "Got this helmet just bc the look was such awe inspired and some!! I had a HJC 17 full face and decide to go with a somewhat open face helmet for summer heat, and this helmet looks was the deciding factor. Compared to my HJC, the wind noise is noticeably louder. More air since the mask is porous; the pins attaching it to the goggles at the nose are loose, so leaving a wider gap than intended. However, standing still with the whole thing on didn't breathe as much as I thought. Head shape is round so I go with a L instead of a M (my head is 60cm, so big for M but on the lower side for L). Chinstrap for the L is a bit short. I tried to tighten as much as I can against my chin but still be able to slip the helmet off without loosen the strap. Strap has a tab that greatly help in loosening. A gal friend said I look like a cricket, due to a big green noggin, black round eyes and square mouth, skinny neck... I guess Im going for that mushroom man look in Mario... The guys said I looked like Cobra commander/storm troopers. Helmet feels lighter than HJC 17. Narrower vision with peripherals are limited. Reflections of car lights can be seen inside goggles due to double layers, not a big safety concern though, more like minor irritating dots... Standard tint is light enough to see after sunset. Foams feel super cheap so not expecting it to hold for repeat usages. Side caps are not as flushed into helmet as I liked, and I hvnt open them to remove the straps. Paddings feel great, and chinstrap didn't irritate... yet. Helmet does require quite a bit of adjustments to get the \"perfect\" feel once wear. Perhaps bc it is size L. Sides of the helmet, the cheeks bars, seemed to press against the face more than they should. Mayb I hv a funny head? For 265 I guess I expected the materials on small parts to be of higher grade, although helmet itself is great quality. Didnt move around at 60mph when headchecked. All in all would recommend it for the looks if you dont mind a bit cheap feeling parts.\n",

      "Helmet is great, very comfortable and gives me that full face feeling of security, but allows the airflow of an open face helmet. Your Website is awesome, huge selection, and amazing prices. My order was ready and shipped in a very reasonable amount of time, especially living in Hawaii i have gotten used to things taking for ever, but you guys really surprised me with how on top of my order you were. All in all I had a great experience with the whole process and really glad I went out on a limb and got my helmet. If I could make one suggestion, it would be. Try to stock hard to find items that others don't even bother with. You guys rock!!\n",

      "The helmets main feature for me is the look, it's epic. I've been riding it in the winter in Florida and even with the vent open my head stays warm, makes me a little worried for the warmer months but we'll see. The helmet has a lot of drag and make a good bit of noise so I don't recommend it for highway travel unless you want a neck workout. I did notice a bit of vision loss on the sides compared to the full-face helmet I normally roll with. Overall I like it, it works great for in town driving and it looks awesome.\n",

The fact that there are goggles helps prevent fogging while working up a sweat during an aggressive ride. Only downside is that i wish it had the same styling with a full face helmet for a little chin protection just in case.

      "Ok, I'm a long term Harley rider (over 30 years and counting) and have always had the customary matt black open face helmet and a pair of wrap round sunnies and when the beard was off a dirty dew rag, I've recently noticed a new breed of Harley rider which at first i wasn't to thrilled with seeing trendy 20 something guys (and girls) riding around on big dollar bikes but I got used to it and embraced the changes, one of which was this new rage of cool looking urban fighter type helmets one in particular caught my eye and after Google webbing it I found it to be a Shark Raw, I bit the bullet and bought one today, After only about 5 mins into my ride i couldn't wipe the smile off my face (Lucky there's a cover to hide my crazed grin) but i have to say this helmet is amazing!!! I've got a big dollar engine build on my 2013 Fat Bob and haven't really been able to work its magic because after 140 km'h my head was about to be seperated from my shoulders, but with the Shark Raw i hit 170 and still pulling before i came to my senses and backed off, So all you die hard open face wearers take note, this helmet is awesome, do yourself a favour and get one!!\n",

Secondly, this helmet is reasonably priced, comfortable, and surprisingly functional. The internals are plush and I have yet to fog up the goggles in this Alabama humidity (it does better than my Arai pinlock shield). This great helmet also managed to somehow fit my Sena headset like they were made for one another.I compare this helmet to a barfly that you reluctantly take back to your place. But, when you wake up sober the next morning she still looks good, has fresh breath, and you don't mind awkwardly cuddling her. This helmet is a pleasant surprise because I expected very little but I received a whole lot.In short, I expected this helmet to be the equivalent of a one night stand but now I am ready to \"take her home to Momma\".\n",

      "Had this helmet less than 60 days and used maybe 10 times before the vent above the goggles started to separate from the helmet. Revzillas' \"satisfaction guarantee\" is a joke. The ONLY avenue I had was to return the helmet and wait the 6-8 weeks to get a new or repaired helmet which would be the duration of my riding season or fix it myself and void the warranty. I would normally just fix it except I just spent almost 300 on the thing and is breaking already. Unbelievably on so many levels. I will never by a shark helmet or go through revzilla again. I'm the motorcycle safety representative at my base and will be sharing my story to the 600+ riders stationed with me. If you are stuck on this style look at the Bell Rogue and I would strongly recommend looking at another online store, there are a million out there.<br><br>Below is the customer service feedback I left revzilla. listen to my experience and take heed or you could be sitting on your couch with a 300 paperweight and no avenues to fix the situation.<br><br>your customer service representative seemed like he wanted to help but did not posses power to do so and that goes for his supervisor as well. If I can spend 300 on a product you sell use it 10 times before it breaks you better have the power to make it right if you want me to come back, and I don't count forfeiting my helmet for 2 months and not being able to ride while I wait making it right. This isn't a question of money but principle, I'm not going to trust something with my head that only lasted maybe 10 rides. I'm going to junk the helmet, buy a new one from a more credible store and share my recommendations with every rider on base at our meetings, mentor rides, and through the regular e mails I send.\n",

Hence the 3 star rating for \"bang for buck\".However, after getting everything put together and learning to modify the way I put on the helmet, I absolutely love this helmet.It's really light and comfy. My peripheral vision might be slightly less but its no big deal because shoulder checks are way easier to do with such a light and round helmet.Sound is loud, but it's technically an open faced helmet, so to be expected.Air flow is awesome even though I was leery of having only one vent on the top. Tonnes of air moves through the mask. With, for the first time ever in any helmet I've owned....zero fogging. None. Even when I tried to fog it up, nada.Its a rounder shaped helmet, but fits me fine, medium fits slightly smaller than an oval helmet but I think that'll disappear after the break in. A plus is that my head doesn't look ridiculously huge, like it does in my ICON Alliance. It's looks freaking BAD A**.This helmet turns head everywhere, almost as much as my Griso.\n",

On the way to our second stop I notice that I was getting an exceptionally increased amount of air flow inside the facial area of the helmet. When we stopped I observed that the lens inside the goggles had detached from the frame on the top. I was able to reattach the lens but it does not feel as structurally sound as it did. I am hoping that his is just an issue with my helmet specifically.\n",

      "This is a \"Good\" Helmet. It COULD be \"Great\"\n",
      "First, let me say how pleased I am with Revzilla's information on its products. Plenty of video info and lots of feedback. Really helps in your decision making.Now to the Shark Raw in Flat Black.As has been mentioned on many other review sites, this helmet is definitely Form over Function. That doesn't mean it doesn't function well...It just has some issues and characteristics that you have to put up with to get the awesome look from the helmet.In other reviews I have read, one of the main complaints was that the helmet arrives with the elastic straps not installed on the helmet and that after installing, users have great difficulty getting the round side cover to sit flush. I appears that Shark is listening as the helmets now arrive with the straps installed on the helmet leaving the user the rather fiddly task of attaching the goggles to the straps. Additionally, the lower plastic face mask is not easy to clip onto the goggles and while Shark advertises you can ride with or without the lower face shield, I feel taking it off and on will quickly break the attachment tabs leaving you without a face mask.I wear x-large in other helmets and that is no different with the Shark so I feel sizing is right on. My helmet was comfortable right from the start and along with it's light weight, I enjoy the fit very much. But, and there seems to be a \"but\" for every good comment on this helmet, it is quite noisy and forget about taking the ridiculous rubber rain plug out of the vent. It ROARS! I was shocked how much louder it is with the plug removed. Needless to say mine will remain in unless it is extremely hot in which case I will wear earplugs.The goggles are super high quality and by far the most comfortable I've ever worn. A+ on the goggles.It's not easy to take on and off. I raise the goggles on to the top of the helmet, remove the helmet and then place the goggles back into position in an attempt to prevent premature stretching of the elastic straps. Same process in reverse to put in on. Don't use this helmet if you fell you may need to make a quick get-away! You'll be busted with the helmet half on... ;)Bottom line. If you are willing to put up with a list of little annoying traits to look sinister on your scoot, you will enjoy this helmet.I'm a retired pilot and have always said, \"Never fly the A model.Well, this is the A model and I look forward to Sharks follow-on Raw helmets to see if they fix all the little squawks\n",

      "All Hail the Naked Crusader\n",
      "I recently purchased the Shark Raw in order to supplement my aging AGV T2. I wanted something a bit different, something that would make me stand out from the crowd of full face and traditional 1/2 and 3/4 helmets.Why the Shark Raw:My issue came when I was trying to locate a helmet that would compliment my bike. See, I ride a Harley Vrod that has been modified to look like a cafe racer. If you don't know, the Vrod is a Harley that truly is not a Harley. The motor was designed with the assistance of porsche and the overall bike is setup to ride on the edge of cruiser capability almost stepping into the realm of sport touring or traditional sport bikes. Because of this, traditional helmets don't look right with it. A full face is too sporty while a traditional 1/2 or 3/4 looks a bit too low key. I needed something that would suit my specific bike, something like a street fighter or naked bike. Thats when I found it. The Shark Raw.The Shark Raw is a radical helmet. Its designed to look like something straight off the deck of an aircraft carrier. It provides the \"Raw\" look needed to co-exist with a \"Raw\" looking bike; i.e. street fighter or naked sport bike, or in my case a Vrod. The helmet exudes an almost primal aura to passer bys that subtly says, \"Yes, I am indeed a bad ***.\"Product Review:The Shark Raw helmet is a well made mid range model that provides great protection at the very, very low weight of under 2.5 pounds. This helmet is hardly noticeable while riding due to this. Protection only stems to 3/4 coverage as the front face shield does not provide any added security. Do not think that the lower face shiled will provide anything in the way of crash protection. Shark mentions that the front face guard is not for safety but more for aesthetic appeal. It does however, do a very good job of keeping bugs and dirt out of your mouth.More on the face mask. The eye protection, or goggles, that come with and are pre-attached to the helmet are very good. The lens that is used is scratch resistance and pre-tinted for day riding. Riding at night is difficult as a result of the tinted lens. The goggles are attached to the main body by an elastic band that allows the goggles to be pulled forward and moved to the desired location. This band than pulls the goggles tight against the face to prevent air and moisture from leaking in around the edges. The lower face mask is made of a plastic material and connects to the goggles via 4 mounting points. These were a huge pain to connect. The mounts are nothing more than small nubs that stick up from the face mask and are inserted through small holes located on the under side if the goggles. I had an extremely difficult time on the 2 inside nubs. I had to push so hard that I thought the goggles were going to buckle in order to get them to connect. Once connect the lower face shield and goggles fit snugly together and provide decent wind and bug protection.There are 2 vents located on the helmet. These vents are located at the top center and provide decent ventilation. The open and close mechanism is nothing more than a stop that is placed inside the vents that can be added or removed to close or open the vents.Noise is moderate with this helmet as it is considered to be a 3/4 face. The goggles and lowed face shield do little to qualm air noise especially on any highway. I found that noise tends to leak in from the neck area under my ears. I do not remember this happening with my full face.Fit and comfort are on the small side at first. However, I think this is typical of helmets as the padding needs to be broken in. During the initial stages of wearing the helmet I found that my ears hurt a bit after an hours ride especially when taking the helmet off. However, after the first 5-10 hours the padding seems to have compacted a bit and the fit is very comfortable. On some side notes on fit and comfort - the goggle padding that contacts the face becomes a bit itchy on very hot days and the lower face mask has a tendency to bow at high speed (highway) and touch my chin.Overall the Shark Raw has been a great helmet. Its a radical, cool looking helmet that provides great protection and comfort while riding. IF you are looking for a slightly flashing helmet look no further as this helmet will get you notices. I have been stopped numerous times not because of my bike, but because of this awesome looking helmet from Shark.\n",

      "This helmet has a very aggressive look that gets noticed,Looks - 5/5. Very agressive looking helmet i got it in flat black to match my bike, This helmet looks great on a cruiser or a street bike and will get you noticed.Fit - The fit on this helmet is a little strange it is very tight on the face tho. There is not way to get this helmet on wearing headphones they get pulled out when you put it on.Noise - 3/5 This helmet is classed as open face and as such is louder then a full face, Installing and using the face mask reduced a large amount og this noise but i would recommend in ear plugs if you ride a loud bike or travel at speed.Weight 3/5 its no carbon fibre but its not that bad.Over notes, The googles feel a little cheap and i can see them needing to be replaced every so often as the foam degrades, Getting the face mask on it a little trickey but once its on it seems to stay. I have trouble with the helmet strap, could be me but i dont think so.Will give more updates as time goes by if needed\n",

      "Although this helmet is advertised as open face you might suppose the faceshield would connect to the goggles more easily and in a more substantial way. This being said, the helmet quality is great. The goggles are sturdy with nice lenses. The strap that articulates holding the goggles looks and feels durable. Should you ever need more goggles or a new face shield they are priced right. Ventilation is adequate with the single scoop and open face but long rides will grant some quality sweaty helmet head.\n",

      "Great aerodynamics a little noise when lifting your head in a straighter position but hardly notable. Super quiet. Goggles are top notch, forgot I was wearing goggles about 5 minutes into my ride. Not tinted too dark but work well. I always need sunglasses but was fine without them unless staring directly at sun. Love the face mask as I like riding around town smiling and singing to myself and this helmet allows me to do that without any one else knowing! Nice spacing for mask as well as I found myself able to reach underneath it and scratch my nose when I needed to. Over all a quality helmet that makes running around town a little more fun. Also note the plastic pins used to hold on the mask do an extraordinary job, not flimsy at all and mask is securely attached to the goggles.\n",

I really like the amount of wind noise and the air flow is perfect, although I might be biased because I used to love riding without a helmet when I was in my 20's and still invincible.I found the cheek pads made the helmet unwearable for me, so I ended up removing them. That is why I set comfort to average.I also think this helmet is probably more money the it is actually worth, just because it looks cool. That's why the bang for the buck is low.\n",

I often will flip the goggles up for city driving or if I want to run into a gas station or something.Helmet seems to run on the small side.

      "The helmet is a really cool design and i am very happy with it but there are a few flaws that i was disappointed in. Ill make a Pros and Cons list for all of you out there looking to buy this helmet.Pros--Cool Design-Love the face mask and goggles (during the day)-Not too hot but i haven't hit summer too hard yet.-Very comfortable-Built very well.-Mask keeps all of the bugs out of your face.Cons--It is pretty noisy in the ears where the goggles connect.-Tinted lens makes it hard to see at night but works good during the day-Putting the helmet on and off will definitly wear out the foam around the goggles eventually.-Seems like the ear covers will also eventually break. Its just made of plastic clips and I'm sure they will break eventually.Overall i really do like the helmet but i am disappointed with how loud it gets and how dark the goggles get at night. It is a pain to take the mask off and store it on the bike just to ride at night. Hope this helps! Safe riding.\n",

      "This is a very good helmet overall. The fit feels great; probably due to the design and amount of padding used. The more rounded shape is the best for my head. Field of vision is as good as any helmet I've tried yet. The look is about as cool as it gets. I get compliments every time I ride. If the Sharktooth system I've ordered fits inside the helmet and works as well as advertised; it will be hard to find a better helmet. My only complaint thus far is that the face guard connection to the goggles is suspect. I haven't had it fall off yet; but time will show if the cheapish looking plastic connecting pins will hold up. That said; Revzilla needs to get the Union Jack face shields in stock so I can buy one.\n",

      "Upon opening box, the Shawk Raw helmet bag is soft and built well. I have others that seemed slightly thin and wouldn't protect the helmet while sitting idle. I do with the bag would be like that of a HJC.Fitment was spot on with my size. No pressure points anywhere while riding. The first time I wore the helmet was on a 40 degree day in December. I rode for a good 4 hours and my face did not get cold at all. There of course was a slight breeze underneath the chin, but nothing to distract me from riding.The goggles did not fog up once, which is why I bought this helmet due to the design of the separate goggles. I did receive a ton of compliments on the helmet. Mainly those of what the heck kind of helmet is that :) The goggles could be slightly darker, however in night riding the visor tint does not hinder my ability to see ahead. The one concern I do have is the elastic on the visor. While the helmet is on, I try to not rotate the goggles to the top of the helmet for fear of the elastic loosing up. I try to take the helmet off if I am going to have a conversation. The quality of the goggles and elastic are top notch. The goggles are a Karl Ziess lenses which are world known for quality and clarity.My only concern is at above 50 mph the wind tends to grab the helmet and pull it back. I wish there was a little more aerodynamics with the helmet to cut through the air a little better. Highway riding does get a bit cumbersome with neck fatigue. I would not wear this helmet if I was riding across the county, a good full face would work much better. I have decided to keep my old helmet for the longer rides due to this. But cruising to work and joy rides I will gladly wear the Shark.The Shark Raw is a great cafe style, bobber helmet with in my opinion very minimal flaws. I would highly recommend this helmet and advise who ever to purchase from REVZILLA. The shipping was fast and perfect. I have never had an issue with anything from REVZILLA.

      "Probably the best 3/4 helmet out there\n",
      "So I've been on a little bit of a helmet buying frenzie the past year or so. I've been looking for the perfect helmet for my cafe racer and started out with a a Bell Custom 500, also bought a Nolan 43, but wasn't completely satisfied until I went with the Shark Raw. This thing is one many things but first and foremost you have to go with what you see, and that's badass. This helemet looks like no other. Truly high end 3/4 helmet meets high end paintball mask. It goes well with the modern cafe theme I've got going (Triumph Thruxton with a mix of classic and modern parts). There is nothing out tehre like the Shark Raw.I've had a Shark full face helmet in the past and I know they fit me exceptionally well and are uber comfortable. This one is no different. Interior is as Anthony described; premium. Very comfortable helmet and yes fits true to size. I'm a small in most helmets and once again small works here.In terms of venting, I've only taken a couple short rides so far. All were taken with the vent plug out (I keep the plug on my Keychain just in case). I can't really tell how it vents yet but I'm not super picky with that kinda stuff. If I'm not stifelingly hot, I'm not complaining.The stability of the helemet in a semi tucked position on a bike with no real wind protection like my Thruxton and this thing gets incredibly stable (as the Shark I've had in the past). You can tell this thing has been well engineered and wind tunnel tested. No buffeting and that's with no bias from a front fairing or anything.Again I have to touch on the look because it is truly unique. The light smoke goggle means a versatile and very functions badass look (you'll be be to ride with em even as the sun drops). I have yet to test them at night. The face mask provides good debris protection (not a chin bar like a full face) and definitely a few steps up from an open face 3/4 helmet.Like Anthony recommended I wouldn't flip the goggle system up too frequently. It may lead to premature wear of the foam. In addition, the goggles are better handled at a traffic light/full stop because you'll need both hands.As with all helmets, I'm not gonna be the best person to ask about noise because I use ear plugs.If you're a streetfighter, cafe, or even city/commuter guy/gal I'd say this is definitely an option to seriously consider. I love this thing.\n",

It does a great job in hot days.Fitment is no surprise but do not forget that it will break in a little bit over time.Here are couple of key points if you consider buying this helmet:- the inner liner and cheek pads are very comfortable, and made out of fleece.- the karl zeiss goggle do a good job blocking debris and they are a little bit tinted protecting fairly from the sun. The foam seal does an incredible job blocking air, and they do not obstruct your vision.- the mouth guard is also efficient in blocking small debris and letting you breath at any speed.- it is extremely light weight and flows a lot of air as you would expect from an open face helmet.I only have one complaint, the little button holding the chin strap is really cheep quality and keep coming off, but it is overall a good product.\n",

Overall though, I do like my purchase and am very impressed w/ the style and look of the helmet. If you are looking for the style and all that goes along w/ open face helmet, I'd recommend it.

I saw the Shark, liked the design, and decided to drop the change to give it a try. My first ride was in the 30-40 degree range without ANY fogging or cold air eating me up. The helmet is quiet, but I can still hear the nuances of my engine and exhaust. Visual range is no more impaired than when wearing goggles, and frankly, is incredibly aerodynamic.

Is a Jet helmet, but is not cool, is hot as a full face helmet, but offer no protection like a full face helmet, and you cant open the visor to cool yourself. Youll need your both hands in order to open the google and mouth piece.2.- The angle of the chin strap is too forward, and gets off your chin very easily, to prevent that, you'll have to strap it very tight, so tight, it could become uncomfortable when you have to swallow.3.- The top vent, needs an extra piece of plastic to close, and you'll have to take off the helmet to put that piece or to remove it. And that tiny piece, will surely get lost if you do not take good care about.4.- On a more personal note, my RayBan aviators get foggy on the red lights. And there is no way you can put, or take off the helmet with the RayBans on.\n",

My GMAX68 did it too.Ive had the helmet for about a month now, I ride every day and the mask is surprisingly good a blocking the cold morning air, not as good as a full face, but not so close to a half helmet either. The goggles are lightly tinted, good enough for the bright desert sun, but light enough to not feel to uncomfortable once the sun goes down. However the optical quality is a little lacking and at night I get ghost lights shift slightly down from light sources.

If you are reading this then you likely think so as well so I won't dwell on that.I find no issues so far with the fit and finish of the helmet. There were no blemishes or obvious defects to be found. The goggles have excellent optical clarity and have yet to fog up on me. Be very careful with the foam that seals the goggles to your face, though...I see Shark doing a brisk business selling replacements when they get torn off as your head goes in and out of the helmet (you could move the goggles but that's a bit of a pain...kind of like that flap on the front of underwear that nobody uses). The part that covers your mouth does a good job of keeping dust and bugs off your face but that's about it...if you're sliding face down on the asphalt don't expect it to protect you (and as far as I know Shark doesn't market it as being a protective piece).It's pretty loud on my fairing and windshield-less bike. However, this is my only non full-face helmet so I'm not sure how it compares to others of the same design. My primary helmet is a Schuberth C3, which is particularly quiet and likely just makes what is normal levels of noise on an open face seem like more than it is.The only kinda-sorta negative I can say about the Shark Raw is that it seems to be a tight fit going on and off. It makes my poor ears angry and red like two little bottles of Tabasco. Fortunately, once the helmet is on the fit is very comfortable. Maybe my head just has a weird shape to it that that guy in Goonies...In all I'm very happy with my Shark Raw. The matte green gives it kind of a kick-butt post apocalyptic soldier look. I think I will also pick up another in black to better match my other gear.\n",

The downside is that the goggles are not dark enough to ward off direct sunshine.Fit is definitely more for those of us with bowling ball heads, and easily accommodates my eyeglasses and balaclava.

      "Like most, waited for this helmet to come stateside. Watched the review and agree with many of the initial thoughts after I pulled the helmet out of the box. Very lightweight as mentioned and compared to my full-face Arai. Did not like how the mask attaches to the goggles (4 small prongs), agree Shark should come up with a better system. The side panels can be a hard to snap back in after replacing the goggle straps. Not sure why Shark didn’t just make a vent switch for top vent, can see the little puck being lost.Initial fit was fine around the forehead, but did get tight around the lower jaw-line with chinstrap. Goggles are kind of a pain to raise up gloved hands (worried about this as a military rider coming on base) and on my long face, chin touches mask.Test ride on Harley with no windshield on a 50 degree day. I do wear earplugs, but thought the wind noise was not bad compared to my Arai (this is my 1st non-fullface). Slight amount of wind when moving head side to side at 70mph. Slight buffet on lower portion of mask at speed. Do hope Shark releases different tinted goggles; stock tint is ok, but really no room for sunglasses.Overall pleased with the fit and finish of the helmet, and co-workers so far have praised the looks. Good price from Revzilla and fast shipping.\n",

      "In the past, if I wore a helmet at all it was always a half helmet. I am so glad I decided to try the Shark Raw. It is a 3/4 helmet that also protects your face and eyes against the elements. The fit seemed a little snug at first (not used to so much coverage) but it feels more comfortable every day. This helmet is much quieter than I'm used to and I wouldn't think about riding in colder weather without it. The built in goggles keep the wind out far better than any sunglasses ever will. I actually believe that the quiet and comfort of this helmet give me better control while riding at highway speeds and it looks great, too. I am loving it!!\n",

The convenience of having all the face protection and eye protection on a open face without having to keep track of separate goggles and face sock or bandanna or whatever you would use to cover your face with any other open face. I get all kinds of compliments with it and I've only had it for a few days. The ear phone compartments are awesome and will let all kinds of helmet com systems or ear phones fit in. The only con i see is the goggles. its not so much the construction or the materials of it as much as it is the way is wears on the helmet. I'm sure they will fix it in later generations but if you're not careful when you bring the goggles down and drag them across the rubber gasket around the edge of the helmet it will start to lift up. Even with this Im still sold on it and will wear it for the foreseeable future. at least until the Sark Raw II comes out.\n",

      "Awesome Look\n",
      "First off I would like to commend Revzilla on excellent customer service. This was my first time ordering and I was really impressed with how fast my product was received. I live in Oahu, Hawaii and it took 5 days to get here, with the weekend. in between. Most importantly, I used the promo code for free shipping! So thank you Revzilla!Helmet PROS:I just received my Shark RAW today...and I love it. The initial roundness of the helmet caught me off guard, and honestly I thought it looked extremely large on my head, but once the face mask is assembled on put on, the whole helmet is breath taking...almost \"Predator\" like. It really fits the time with its futurist look, while retaining some classic style as well. As for its large appearance, I placed it next to my ICON Armada and it is actually a bit smaller, so I'm convinced that the roundness of the helmet makes it look larger than it really is. I wear a large and it fit perfect, and it is lighter in weight than my ICON.Helmet CONS:The face mask is awesome, however if Shark can develop a better material than the foam around the goggles I think it will have more longevity. I can tell that in a few months the foam will start to get torn and make not be so comfortable to wear. Also, I was hoping that the low mask coving the nose and mouth was going to be a hard plastic...its not...it actually very flexible and with a strong cross wind it feels like it may just blow off your face. There is no way you can ride with this in the open/up position. With that being said, you are really over paying for a 3/4 helmet because it comes with some cheap goggles and a face mask to create that awesome look.Suggestion to Shark...develop a better insulating material for the goggles or develop a integrated sun visor, this way it give the rider an option #which we all love to have#, and it would look even better, #more aviator like# and would be worth the current cost. The mask should be a more durable plastic and firmly attachable/detachable to the helmet not the goggles.Overall:Awesome design, very revolutionary, and I believe it is a good start to a trend. With a few improvements, I can't wait to see what the next generations look like.\n",

I love it!It is your ultimate urban helmet, very light and nice looking.The only down side i found was that the detachable face part is not that clever designed and not that comfortable to attached.If you looking for light, unique and nice helmet, this is the one.Another point to take into consideration is that this one might be little tight on you: I am usually ordering size M helmet and this one M is little tight on me (not sure if it is because the helmet shape and my head shape, but worth to mention this fact).\n",

I haven't worn the helmet for anything other than commuting, but for the 30 min or so I'm wearing it at a time, it feels great!I'm impressed with the venting in the helmet, and the visor is easy to get on and off.

      "I got my first mc just short of a year ago; an HD Sport Glide.  I promised myself I'd only ride in full gear.  First I got an HJC 3/4 helmet then decided I should get full face protection.  I heard some say any helmet under $700 is junk, but I was attracted to the Snell rating and the about $200 price tag.  When I first tried it on it felt tight but after a month it was fine.  I don't have much to compare with but it's made well, fits fine, noise level seems decent.  It does feel pretty aero at high speed and when I turn my head sideways the air doesn't grab it or make a lot of noise.  For $200 it seems to me like an outstanding helmet.  There's no way on earth a $700 helmet is over 3 times as good.  I'm very happy with the 710.  I got my daughter an earlier model 410 or 420 ($) for $100 at end of 2017 for $100 ... another good value helmet.\n",

So I returned it and got the size up and it fit perfectly. The airflow is great when on the road and the moisture wicking is outstanding. While wearing it in my MSF course in the middle of summer I never felt like I was drowning. Its Snell rated and that’s about the best for safety that I have found.\n",

First I was connecting my sena and found the ear holes are too small for the speakers, I don't know why they didn't keep them the same as the R410. But my main issue with the helmet and reason for a 1 star review is that the inside shell can be pulled down from the outer shell. I tested it out on my R410 helmet and it does not budge an inch. To add insult to injury I probably won't be able to take it back as I put a camera mount on the helmet before I noticed the issue. So I'm stuck with a $200 paperweight. Be careful buying this helmet. Make sure to check if the inside moves by pressing down where the nose shield is located, if it moves I would not wear it.\n",

It's not overly quiet, but it's by no means loud. I was in between sizes and went with the size below. Helmet is really snug. Almost too snug. I stuck with the helmet and as the pads have conformed it feels better and better, and more natural. The helmet is lighter than my brother's modular helmet, and I find that to be a plus. I was looking for some great safety features and this helmet had them. For the low price, I am really happy here. I think I'll continue to get happier as the helmet continues to break in. I've only ridden this thing in colder climates (no more than 65 degree F), so I can't speak to how hot it gets. Air flow has been decent, especially just cracking the visor. The ability to make minor adjustments to defog is wonderful. Really impressed (I used to fog a paintball mask almost instantly when I used to play). I really recommend this as a safe, and decently stylish helmet. I'll have it for a long time.\n",

The weight seems quite light and is comfortable wearing around the house.I measured my skull to be 59.7cm (23.63\") which is near the upper-end of the Large and it fits very comfortable like I barley notice it -- I removed the cheek pads just to be sure it was a good fit.  The cheek pads are tight and will require some breaking in; I weighted them down for 24hrs under some small weights and it helped just a bit -- the rest will have to be done by wearing it.Regarding the face shield -- it does have an issue fully seating against the lower gasket when closed.  I found this apparently solved by forcing it closed by pinching the face-shield closed using the chin bar and the tab on the shield.  This fully seats the face-shield against the gasket and takes less than 1 sec.  Will this solve others' whistling and road noise reduction?? not sure.\n",

Holy shit my face hurts. If you have any cheeks, throw something in the helmet to let the padding stretch out some. I wore mine for one day and my face literally hurt for hours. I rolled up a rain shell & t-shirts for 4 days and jammed them in there and switched back to my old helmet. After 5 days of stretching it was barely tolerable. I'm 5'11 180. Not a fat dude or fat face.2. Wear glasses? Forget it. Padding bends your temple arms so the glasses dont fit on your face correctly.3. Cutouts for bluetooth headsets are laughable. Maybe 1/8\" deep. 4. Location of ear cutouts way off. Sena20S speakers dont sit in the non existent pocket so its either have your ears pressed to your skull trying to get it to fit, or have the speakers down where your jaw hinges. Would I recommend this? Absolutely not. If I didnt wear this on the hottest day of the year and sweat into it so that I couldn't return it, I would have personally delivered it to Revzilla in Philly so I could tell them to destroy this thing! Since Im stuck with it I'll try another round of stretching it and see if I can shave some of the plastic around the speaker cutouts and make it so my ears are pressed against my skull.\n",

      "First street helmet\n",
      "After doing some extensive research, reading reviews and watching videos, I found the Scorpion EXO 710. What first attracted me to the helmet was the design. Very sleek and kind of mean looking. It is lightweight so I can wear this for several hours without my neck muscles being stressed. I like that I can swap visors easily, I ride mostly in the day so I attached the tinted visor within seconds. The biggest con I have is the wind noise. I have been adjusting vents to achieve the optimal wind noise to cooling factor but no matter what I try it is still somewhat loud. The other function I am getting used to are the cheek pads. They really push on the cheeks and it takes a little squeezing or maneuvering to get the right comfort. The rest of the helmet fits like a glove and to be fair, I am used to riding with an open faced helmet versus the street style so it could be me more than the padding itself. I really like this choice and recommend it to others who are looking for a lightweight, good fit, and affordable helmet.\n",

I rode for 3 hours, mid summer in Texas, 100+ degrees and the air flow on the helmet was amazing. The 2mm flip of the front visor is a GAME CHANGER'!The noise level is low.

Secondly, the chin guarding is locked in by white triangular teeth, constantly sliding out of place. This is the worst part about this helmet.Air flow: opened the vents while riding, no difference in temperature around my face.

      "Helmet looks great and is pretty dang comfy. I was a little nervous at first because it fit tighter than I liked, but it broke in very quickly. My complaints are that the Bluetooth speaker cut outs are too small for my Sena SMH10R. I had to cut out a small area of the foam to accommodate. The other issue (and most annoying) are that the cheek pads come unsnapped way too easily when removing the helmet. This wasn't really the case until after I removed them to install my Bluetooth. I don't understand the problem because the clips are not damaged. To fix the problem, I press up onto the bottom of the cheek pads with my thumbs when removing the helmet. If it gets worse, I'll have to check on getting it warrantied.Other than that, great helmet.\n",

      "Great Helmet Except Cheek Pad Issues\n",
      "I have only put about 150 miles on the helmet but it is obviously significantly quieter and has better airflow than my old HJC. The ventilation is great and the brow vent makes a huge difference. There is a bit more wind noise when the vents are open, but it also seems to muffle outside noise a little less than other helmets so you could wear earplugs with no issue. My head measured 24\" exactly, so I got the XL, which was great except it was not tight around the crown of my head. So I went down to the L which is very tight in the cheek pads. I cannot buy XL cheek pads to fix the issue because they are two different shell sizes. So the cheek pads fit tightly and they sometimes slide out when I take off my helmet due to the emergency removal system. With the right technique and after it breaks in a bit more I think it will be a great helmet.\n",

At first it was a bit too tight but then it molds to your face and head. The right pad cheek does begin to slide off its place after my third month wearing it. I don't know why because it's not broken or anything. I use a anti-fog solution to wipe the visor and have not really tested it out without it. Every time I wash my bike I use the same wax/cleaner from my bike to wax the helmet so that it doesn't begin to loose it's shine. All around it's a great helmet for the buck.

      "This is my second Scorpion helmet (purchased the matte black, size XL). I upgraded from the EXO-1000. I have to say, the R710 is a lot roomier on the inside compared to the old Scorpion. I inserted my Sena SMH10 speakers into the speaker pockets, but they don't fit correctly (because the speakers aren't perfectly round where the wiring connects). If that was the only issue, I would've been relatively happy with the purchase. Alas, it is not.After 100+ miles wearing this helmet, I wish I could return it. The visor is sticky - it's remarkably difficult to open or close - whenever it's not positioned somewhere in between. And when the visor is down, it still doesn't create a great seal.Which brings me to my next point. This helmet is just too GD loud. Even with all of the vents closed, wind noise was audible over 30 mph. Over 45mph and you'll get this constant whistling that only gets louder the faster you go. Open the vents and it's almost like you're standing directly behind a jet engine. And yes, I always ride with ear plugs!In my old EXO-1000, whenever I picked up a call into my Sena communicator, no one realized I was talking to them whilst on two wheels. Not so with this helmet. \"WHAT?\" or \"WHERE ARE YOU?\" are the things people frequently ask when I talk to them via the Sena unit.I bought this helmet (with a dark smoke shield) for that BAMF murdered out look. I love that the solid matte design has no logos or graphics of any kind. And taking the Scorpion \"S\" off of the front is easy. I sacrificed looks for peace and quiet. I'm willing to put up with it, but I wish I had gone with a different brand. This will be my last Scorpion helmet.\n",

      "I've been through a few helmets and wanted something that'd be quieter and more aerodynamic on the highway than my old Biltwell Gringo S, but didn't want to spring for the pricier Japanese or Euro stuff. This helmet is a fantastic value for the price. Unlike some of Scorpion's other products, it fits true to size; I wear a L in this as I have in every other brand of helmet I've tried. It's comfortable and I noticed the high build quality right away; it has more of a \"premium\" feel to it than I expected.If you're concerned about wind noise and buffeting like I was, this is probably about as good as it gets at this price point. I'd just wear earplugs if on the interstate for any length of time with any helmet, but short urban expressway runs are much quieter and more pleasant than in my old lid, and it doesn't catch wind like a sail when doing a head check the way some helmets do. My only tiny gripe with this helmet is that I wish the visor were a little more open when in \"city\" mode (which is still a great feature.)Helmets from the premium Japanese or Euro manufacturers are probably quieter, lighter and more aero, but they're also twice as expensive or more (and not necessarily any safer!). If you're on a budget, this is a pretty ideal balance between quality and affordability.\n",

      "First real helmet is pretty good\n",
      "This helmet fit my head a little snugly initially and broke in to be very comfortable, but tight to my head. The air vents block air when closed and let a good amount in when open. I ride a CBR250R, so I'm at what I think people call a 3/4 upright position, certainly not a full tuck but not lounging like those cruiser riders ;). Sometimes I ride completely upright, and occasionally at as much of a tuck as the bike allows. In all of these conditions the noise and airflow are roughly the same. I followed the sizing guide from Revzilla and the sizing chart seemed spot on.I bought the white helmet. It gets noticed. I don't seem to get pulled out in front of any more frequently than I do in my car. I often see the cagers notice me. My buddy saw me and my helmet on the highway one day by happenstance, and said he saw it like a white beacon from at least a mile away. That's some visibility.Even on the coldest mornings at about 20f and below with the warmest breath, the screen only marginally fogs up at stops. Above that temperature it pretty much never fogs at all and never while moving. It's warm in cold weather with the vents closed and a balaclava on, and comfortably cool with the vents open in hot weather. There's a neat 'visor crack' feature that allows you to lock the shield with a small opening at the bottom so you can safely get additional air when barely moving, too.This is my first 'real' helmet, so I don't have much to compare it to, but when I'm ready to replace it I'll look to Scorpion first. BTW, that silver 'S' logo on the front can be cut off with a hobby/x-acto blade and the remaining adhesive can be removed with the warm, wet towel cleaning method.\n",

On my Alliance, air leaks through the front vent even when it's closed but the way the vent works on this helmet makes a perfect seal.I just got the plain white so I can't comment much on style, but I plan to put some cool stickers on it.The cheek pads squeeze my face a little bit and make my already present overbite much worse. So I need to get something smaller for the sake of my orthodontic health.Overall, a great helmet. If you have a long oval head it will be a little tight but it's much better than the Alliance.\n",

I laid it down at a really low speed (20-25mph) and the helmet barely got scuffed (except the visor, that got pretty scratched) and for sure protected my head.Would I suggest this helmet to a friend or family member? Yes. You're not going to find a better helmet features wise, and that is Snell 2015 rated. Will I be buying this again?

I haven't had a serious crash yet thankfully but this helmet should protect me well in the event that things go awry.Wind noise is ok, but it can get pretty noisy at highway speeds. I always wear ear plugs though and that helps bring the noise down.Ventilation is ok but on hot days with all the vents open it can feel like you need some more to cool down. The weight isn't bad either: I have not had neck cramps yet and I have gone on 3-4 hour long rides. My butt always gets sore before my neck ever does so that's a plus for this helmet.This helmet also easily fits my rectangular framed glasses. Thick rimmed hipster glasses may have some fitment trouble but I doubt it. My frames are average sized and they go in no problem.Sizing seems to match what is listed online. I picked my helmet blind based off of Revzilla's sizing chart and had no issues with fitment.Finally the helmet looks good. I wasn't a fan of the stupid chrome \"S\" on the front but that's just adhered with double stick foam tape so it easily comes off with some goo gone and dental floss.Overall if you're a newbie or on a budget then this is a good safe helmet choice.\n",

      "I am very pleased with this helmet thusfar. i went with the matte black version and feel that it has a very aggressive look while most importantly being very comfortable. The face shield is easy to manage and the option to crack the face shield without opening it completely gives the perfect amount of airflow when riding at the slower speeds necessary when riding around town. If i get moving faster then adjustment is as easy as flipping the lever down and even while completely closed the numerous air vents keep my head cool and sweat free. This is no small feat as i am a large fellow prone to sweating. Even though I shave my head regularly I have noticed no pressure points whatsoever. Perhaps it would be even more comfortable to those of you who have hair for even more padding.......but i cannot see how as i would still rate it 5 of 5. Sunglasses easily fit on my head once the helmet is on with no pressure on the ears (though my next purchase will probably be a dark smoke face shield to eliminate the need for them altogether as well as to further improve the look of the helmet). I have no experience with other motorcycle helmets, but after playing football for years and spending time in iraq wearing an ach (military ballistic helmet) on missions, i can attest as to the comfortability of this even with no break in period. Have also had zero problems with visability. I would highly recommend this helmet to anyone interested in a helmet purchase.\n",

As for comfort, I can easily ride for several hours straight without hot spots, or discomfort whatsoever. The airflow is good, and defiantly helps in the 90+ degree heat we have been having here in Northern California.

      "Have always worn full face Snell rated helmets but last helmet I tried a Scorpion open face to get more air flow in summer. Really liked some features of the Scorpion so when it was time to upgrade, I read and reread and watched and re-watched the Revzilla reviews and videos. As I really wanted to get back to a full face I tried the EXO R710.Absolutely lives up to the other reviews, a Snell rated helmet that is comfortable, good looking, and the venting absolutely works ! So far loving this helmet.Only slight concern are cheekpads are a bit full for me and press slightly on my jaw but I believe they will break in.\n",

      "This is a wonderful first helmet to have. The price is in the perfect area and it offers all the features of a higher priced one. The material of the helmet makes it so it's super light to wear. Tons of airflow when the vents are open, though the downside to that is it creates a good amount of wind noise, but i ignore it mostly.\n",

      "Good helmet. Fits perfectly, wasn't tight around the ears like other brands.\n",
      "Pulled the trigger on this after seeing the review video. The helmet fits perfectly, size chart was spot on. It does start to whistle around 40+ mph when the face shield is up but I don't really mind it. Others might find it annoying though. No issues when the shield is down, wind flow in the helmet is pretty nice at higher speeds and cools the top of your head pretty well.All I need now is the tinted face shied to stop the sun from bothering my eyes but for some reason it's always out of stock.\n",

      "Great first helmet\n",
      "I originally picked a different helmet for my first motorcycle helmet but the fit was wrong (entry/shape, not size). I reached out to Revzilla customer service who helped my pick a better helmet for my head based on the experience I had with the first one I tried. I am thrilled that the Revzilla team led me to the R710 because I love this helmet.I feel that this is a great moderate featured helmet at a reasonable price. Airflow is fantastic once you are moving but at a stop I have to flip up the visor or I will get some fogging. I docked a little bit on style for the weird Scorpion 'S' on the forehead but otherwise it's an excellent shape with great airflow, DOT/SNELL approved, and very comfortable to wear.The only negative I would mention about this helmet is the emergency remove cheekpad feature makes it so the cheekpads unsnap from the helmet every single time I take it off. It's a minor inconvenience to re-snap them every time but it would not sway me from recommending this helmet or buying another.\n",

      "Good speaker cutouts, bad they will not fit Sena 10's .The speaker indents are too small, they are smaller than the Sena speakers. The Sena speakers are round with a small extension on them. There is no way to fit them. On the plus side the padding offers enough to place the speakers inside without making pressure points on the noggin. The area that the speakers need to go offers no material to stick the speakers to go you will have to break out the sticker tape that came with your Sena system to make adhesion points. The neck roll extends up inside the side of the helmet making the install of the left speaker tricky.I love the features of the helmet and the spring loaded visor but there is no setting that opens the visor a crack for city driving as what I saw in the video. They must have removed that so you open the visor a crack and then lock it in place .\n",

      "I loved Scorpion helmet.. This was more of an upgrade for me from the exo750.Only reason why I didn't give a 5 stars are because it's loud over 50mph if only the front lower vent are open, even with ear plug on I can still hear..Once the vent are closed the noise goes away.. Now, that's new to me..Never have any kind of noise before on my other Scorpion helmets along with other brand such as Shoei.\n",

      "I did a ridiculous amount of research and a lot of helmet shopping and trying on before buying this helmet. I have a narrow to neutral shaped head and the Scorpion large is exactly my right circumference. I also run much hotter than the average person so besides fit, air flow was critical for me. I ride a vespa and also wanted to customize the helmet graphics with reflective tape and a Vespa sticker, so the helmet needed to be Vespa style and not motorcycle style. This helmet is perfect for me in all of those ways. Plus its affordable and have some great extra little features. Love it!\n",

I can actually feel the hair on the top of my head blowing in the breeze and when I take off the helmet I have to pick the bugs out of my hair. The only two issues I have with the helmet are that the chin vent whistles when in the full open position and there is quite a bit of wind resistance when you turn your head from center.\n",

Went on a ~4 hour ride, and at the end, my friend said that his forehead hurt from his helmet. I gave a good thought about if my helmet had inconvenienced or distracted me at any point in my ride, and I had no complaints. The same friend later bought a much more expensive helmet, which I tried on. I still have to say that I prefer this Scorpion helmet.If I had any gripes, it would be the shape of the helmet and the silly S logo on the front of the helmet. I'm also not sure how protective this helmet is in crash situations (let's hope I never find out) but the padding inside seems decent.I haven't tried many helmets, but at this price point, I don't know if you can beat this helmet when it comes to comfort, vision, and bang for the buck.I'm sure I'm coming back for this helmet if I'm ever in the market again.\n",

      "Ive road with this helmet for 2 almost 3 months now, first off for this price for a SNELL 2015 rated helmet it is a GREAT buy. it has very good airflow. I got the solid white to try and be more visible and safe on the streets. i actually wear my glasses with this helmet and its pretty comfortable even though its a pain to slip them on at first. it IS on the louder side but still tolerablefor sizing help, my old helmet was a cheap speed and strength ss700 i believe \"Go For Broke\" i was a size medium in that helmet. in this helmet i am a small and its a nice snug fit like a helmet is supposed to feel. i was torn between this and the icon airmada but i tried it on and i was a medium but it for sure was NOT for my head shape i had really bad pressure points towards the back sides of my head..any who my only main dislikes with the exo710 is the cracked position for the visor should be a little more open because if you crack open without using that feature its way too big of a gap something could easily fly up in your helmet, ANDDDD for having one of the best fog shields apparently it doesn't do too much of a good job, in 60 degree weather it fogs up easy for me even with the cracked position :/ BUT this is an awesome safe helmet and I'm very please with my purchase. i only put that it ran small because I've never been a small in anything in my life so i was shocked LOL but the sizing chart is very accurate!!!\n",

That meant it to was too big! So I returned it and got a small, hoping it wouldn't crush my head....my head measures at the high end of small, low end of medium, so it really depends on the helmet. I got the small, and it's snug for sure, but it's SUPPOSED to be. After a week using it, it's snug but not too tight. Definitely the right size for my head. Feature wise, the helmet has everything you'd want. No drop down sun visor, but I have prescription sunglasses so I wouldn't use that feature anyway. Speaking of glasses, this helmet is VERY glasses friendly....no more red marks from your glasses crushing the side of your face. Definitely one of the selling points for those who wear glasses.\n",

      "I have owned at least 4 scorpion helmets spanning close to 50k miles and a dozen bikes. I have had big accidents and small accidents and always walked away without issue due to my Scorpion helmet.It was time to update my old 750 so I jumped on the new 710. The fit is great, my sena 20s bolted right in. It has space for my gopro mount, and provides great comfort.compared to my busted up old 750, it provides considerable noise reduction but it is perhaps still a touch loud. The other major issue is I am seeing quite a bit of fogging - the crack open lever is not enough to get rid of it, and the first click leaves about an inch of space under the visor (ie way too much). I would prefer the visor raise about 1/2 cm on the first click but its an excellent helmet for the money and I am quite happy.Here is to many more miles and adventures in my new helmet.\n",

For some reason lowering the chin bar pulls the lower side pads in significantly.  Otherwise the fit was perfect for me, so getting a different size helmet wasn’t going to fix the problem.  Note that  my jaw width is average to narrow, so it’s not that I have a wide face.  This is a design issue.  I was able to order thinner chin pads ($23.00) which helped a lot but shouldn’t be necessary. My previous helmet was a Scorpion EXO 900, a much better fit and quieter. If I had it to do over I’d spend a little more and get a better helmet.\n",

I had heard that modulars can be louder but not this one.I bought the dark smoke shield and it looks great with excellent optics. As a bonus, when you ride directly into the sun you can drop the built in goggles down and it is perfect!  I decided to take a look at this particular model because of reviews but mostly because of Ryan's review on Fort nine (Search YouTube  for him, excellent reviews and the links go right to Revzilla's site) I can't recommend this enough even with price aside which is an excellent deal.\n",

      "Not bad considering\n",
      "Not bad considering that my last helmet was a $700+ Schuberth C3, which is in pretty prime territory. The HJC is different in many ways, not all of them bad. For starters, it's snug and comfortable. True, it's more difficult to wiggle my glasses on when the helmet's on my head, and I can just pop it on with the glasses already in place. But that's okay. The helmet doesn't wiggle my glasses around, making vision jump, so it's just a new part of the helmet-donning ritual. Schuberth owns its own wind tunnel, so it's not surprising that the HJC is noisier when on the move. But earplugs drop the sound to an acceptable level, and I always wear earplugs. The other questionable aerodynamic aspect is a buffeting at high speed that does upset one's vision. At least until I discovered that if II just pick my head up, it stabilizes. So it's like becoming accustomed to progressive eyeglasses. At first you consciously move your head to correct the situation, then you do it automatically without thinking about. The one thing I thought would annoy me was using the good old D-ring chinstrap after becoming used to Schuberth's ratchet system. But no, a lifetime of D-ring helmets before the C3 had burned the necessary finger gymnastics indelibly in my brain. The only real disadvantage this helmet has versus its upscale predecessor is the internal visor lever, which is on top of the helmet. Down at the left edge is where the C3 has it, and that's clearly a better position. But every time I fumble on top of the HJC for the lever, I try to think about this helmet's $148 price point. After that, I just enjoy the ride.\n",

      "The helmet is pretty nice.  Arrived faster than I could get a tracking number for it as well.The internal sun visor hits my nose if I put it all of the way down (xl size) however it stays half way down no issues which I believe is a feature of the next level up helmet.Noise at 70 mph on the highway isnt bad, but you can hear it.  There is a slight whistle as well, but not unmanageable.I am of irish decent and have that square irish jaw.  It is super tight on the jaw line.  I am hoping over time it loosens up.It feels every bit of 4 pounds, but the flexibility of opening the front, or the visor while keeping the internal visor down when in less than 20 mph driving conditions is super nice.There are pockets for speakers, but I wear ear plugs because for whatever reason, I swear the helmet amplifies my d&b bobcat pipes on my harley.I got the pinlock in it as well, and it works flawlessly.  I wouldnt get it without spending the extra few bucks for the pinlock screen.All and all bang for the buck it is a worthy helmet.\n",

      "I just rode 8 miles with my 4 year old IS-17 and picked up my new CL-Max 3 off of my front porch and after swapping out the visor with the reflective blue one that I also purchased and snapping in the pinlock insert and chin curtain, I rode 8 miles back to work with my new CL-Max 3.  So, first impressions: LG {Large) is about the same LG.  The integrated sun visor, in the CL-Max 3, works better than the IS-17 sun visor.  I can, however, occasionally tap the end of my nose on the sun visor when it is down and that had never happened with my IS-17.  The CL-Max 3 is slightly quieter when facing the wind.  And, a-lot quieter when I turn my head side on to the wind.  The padding around the speaker cut-outs has an edge that just touches my ear.  It is not terrible, but it is annoying.  The pads are stiff, but I know that they will get more comfortable as they age.  The accommodation for wearing glasses is much improved in the CL-Max 3.  The chin-curtain is more substantial than the mesh one that I installed in the IS-17.  So, the chin curtain blocks more air flow than I was used to.  But being able to lift the chin-bar when I stop makes that point a little moot.  I had upgraded the visor gearing on my IS-17 to metal.  The look and feel of the gearing on the CL-Max 3 makes me think that I will be upgrading the detent gearing on the CL-Max 3 at some point also.  The CL-Max 3 is a much easier helmet to get on and off.  The vents are easier to operate on the CL-Max 3, also. - happy after my first ride.\n",

      "My first helmet I bought was some LS2 for the same price as this Scorpion and when I got me a new Alpinestars jacket I figured I'd get me the White, black, and red Scorpion helmet to match, and the difference in quality is massive.This helmet feels so much more protective than that LS2 and is much more comfy. This one has way more features too like the emergency straps on the face cushions and the bluetooth headset pockets, the only thing the LS2 has over this helmet is the quick release and quick lock chin strap but that isn't much of a problem.I wear glasses and I can hardly feel my glasses when I wear this helmet which is good. I know the visors are advertised as anti fog but they aren't perfect since they will fog up a bit on cold and rainy days, for the price I really can't complain. Visors also feel real heavy duty and lock into place nicely wherever you put it, it's be almost a year and its still going strong whereas a couple of months on the LS2 and the visor on that one is all loose and doesn't lock into place anymore.This is an excellent helmet and you can't go wrong with it.

I've been riding an upright adventure bike during peak summer heat in Phoenix AZ and the airflow is perfect. It fits me perfect according to the sizing chart, and the field of view is on point as well. The sound dampening is just right, not too much to where I can't hear what's going on around me, but enough to where my ears aren't being assaulted going 65mph. The spoiler on the back does however create a little bit of drag when doing shoulder checks but hardly enough to be worth mentioning, as well as a whistling sound while your head is turned. Overall, you can't beat this for the price.\n",

The Exo-420 was great for me because I loved how stylish the white red black design looked with my similar colored 2014 Kawasaki Ninja. This helmet fits intermediate oval people and it was very comfortable for me. It gave me enough vision on the side so that I can see directly to the side while looking straight ahead and the air flow through the helmet was perfect. I live in the hot and dry California, and this helmet worked wonders for me. As my first helmet, I was extremely pleased at the fact that it was very cheap in comparison to other DOT + Snell rated helmets so I really liked the Scorpion 420.Get it.

For that price it pretty much gives you everything you want for a good starter helmet. I’d recommend it to anyone who just wants a low budget helmet that can provide with most/all of the necessities. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the fact that I start to feel pain on the top of my head after an hour of riding. -understand that this is my personal issue- (just me and my head lol) this is my only problem with the helmet but otherwise it’s amazing!\n",

      "I looked at a lot of helmets before I bought this one. I'm perfectly happy with it. There are a lot of vents on it and the biggest problem is deciding which ones to close. I made the mistake of keeping them all open during a torrential rainstorm and got a little too wet. That gave me a great opportunity to take out the pads and reinstall them. They are a little tough to put back but I've learned the process. The rain also shortened the \"break-in\" time on the cheek pads.  They feel as comfy as an Arai or Shoei set of pads, it's even easier for me to use my eyeglasses. Lastly, the helmet fits my Cardo Freedom 2+ perfectly.  The speaker cavity is located perfectly over my ears, so I have no problems with phone calls or listening to music. I hope this helmet will remain in production for a long time, because I really don't want to switch to another model/brand in five years.\n",

I unscrewed part of the helmet to find a large crack under it. I was out of the 30 return period and I thought I might have bumped it on something so sucked it up and eventually bought another one. I figured, \"What are the odds of buying another one and it being cracked?\" and bought the same one again. Upon receiving it, I looked it over and to my amazement ANOTHER CRACK! Almost the same position as my old one but on the left side. I was shocked. I called revzilla and started the return process.There must be a problem with these helmet's structure around the ear sections of the helmet. I advise against this helmet for anyone.

      "I'm someone jumping from a $140 LS2 Helmet to this one and the difference in quality is crazy. The first thing you'll notice in the jump is the visor, the visor feels way more durable and the way it locks to wherever you put it is really nice. The air flow is also really good in my opinion for both the face and the top of your head. I also really like that the chin opening has an option for when its rainy or cold outside to direct air straight into the visor so it doesn't fog up as much. The only complaint I have that might not really count is the chin strap, the LS2 had a chin strap that was really quick to put on and take off where as this one has the 2 rings and the strap you have to button in. I say this complaint might not count because I'm not sure which one is safer but I'm guessing the double rings strap is the safer option, just not as convenient to what I'm used to.Overall though, this is a really cool helmet and I like the white/black/red color.Remember this is a dope looking snell rated helmet for less than 200 dollars.\n",

SUPER COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT WEIGHT! Great visibility. Great anti fog. Great fit. If you are even remotely thinking about pirchasing, just do it. I have the black and titanium colorway and get compliments all the time. Very quiet even at high speed.Pros:-Comfy-Pre determined spots for Sena speakers-Great front ventilation-Looks incredible-Light weight-Snell ratedCons:-Top of the head ventilation leaves something to be desired-It is very hard to find places on this helmet to mount accessories (GoPro, Sena, etc) the shape of the helmet is very complex in all of the mounting places you would want to use. Having the pre cut wholes for speakers inside you would think they would leave you a semi usable spot for your unit.-Only comes with clear visor. For the price I can't complain but replacements are like 70 bucks for tinted-Wish it had a drop down sun visor but sunglasses are comfortable inside-I always have an issue with the snap on the strap. Like it gets stuck where you can't use it and takes a little to wiggle it back to where it needs to be. -Wish it had a determined spot for a microphone like it does the speakers.

This is my second helet, just moved from a bilt techno 2.0. The vision on the is17 is slightly more narrow and its slightly heavier but its nothing dangerous or really annoying. i just noticed when i first rode in it. If it were a little bit quieter it would be even better. sometimes its hard to communicate with the sena because of the wind. ive ordered the chin curtain which will hopefully help this issue.also i bought it for 250 not the 199 its on closeout right now for. i kinda wish i had known but too late i guess\n",

      "Great features in a cool looking helmet.\n",
      "Great ventilation, comfortable face contact surfaces, cool graphics. Retractable sun visor is a nice feature I wouldn't normally look for but after now having it I wouldn't want to be without it on my daily commute to work in the morning. Took Features down a notch because the visor latch system fails to retain the visor on one side if opened all the way after changing visors. Annoying if I forget and snap open my visor to talk and one side pops off. Needs beefier retention plastic for the locking lug.\n",

Overall a good helmet for the price. The only real issue I have is that the chin strap seems further back than previous helmets I owned. The strap likes to sit nearly on top of my Adams apple.\n",

      "Was impressed with my initial appraisal of the helmet. Fit and finish was excellent. Seems true to size and shape with a comfortably snug fit. The metal in the paint is more of a dust than a flake and looks great regardless of what you think of the style. It's very comfortable, controls feel solid and the amber not too yellow. Some I've had in the past were too bright for sunny days. I installed the pin-lock anti-fog and expect that to be as in the past with others and fog proof. The visor has a thickish and very solid feel. Vision was clear with the pinlock and built in sunscreen. I bought it as a spare and casual use helmet and expect to have some fun with the style.\n",

      "I am seriously in love with this helmet. The ventillation is superb. I have no complaints about the field of vision, as I never see helmet. I know a lot of people say this helmet runs small, but for me it runs true to size. It is seriously so light I barely notice it on. In my opinion it's a quieter helmet, although if you're looking for a completely noise canceling helmet you'll be disappointed. The internal sun visor is an added perk, and it works like a gem. I would highly advise getting the pin lock insert with this helmet, i tried to fog up my visor while stopped in traffic and it just wouldn't happen, if you ride in cooler weather you'll want the pin lock for sure! Also, the chin curtain even though it's mesh, makes a pretty big difference with managing airflow, and diverts a lot of air away from your face, and while I wish they were included with the helmet, they are most certainly worth purchasing.\n",

      "Saved my life\n",
      "I'll go in order of the categories listed:Bang for the buck- It's a beautiful helmet for a very affordable price that has decent features and a premium style graphic that will save your head in a crash, if you love Iron Man at all you can't go wrong with this helmet at all. Side note, the amber visor is difficult for me to see with at night and is a little weird to use in the day with the color shift. Small gripe as that is easily fixable, do wish it came with the clear as well though.Protection and Durability- I crashed on the freeway at 50+ and impacted head first. Came out with a concussion that had no lasting effects. For durability, it's a helmet, it scratched to hell and now im replacing it with an identical one because i love it so much.Features- drop down shades, and a pinlock ready visor out of the box, for the price it really doesn't get much better.Comfort- It runs small, according to size chart i should be a large, however i needed a XL to not have my cheeks squeezed in like a chipmunk. Style- It's iron man. I had 100 different people tell me how cool it was while i was at the dealership waiting on paperwork to be filled. you will get people staring and a ton of comments.Fit- It's small, see my Comfort reviewShape- it's more circular than oval, fits me perfectly.Weight- ~3lbs. pretty average, dont notice the weight while wearing it but can be annoying to carry for long periods of time.Vision- The only thing you see of the helmet is the very edge of it on your peripherals, tons of visibility.Noise- Wear ear plugs with it, it's decently loud, but not deafening.Air flow- There really isn't any, only to front vents that aren't huge, be prepared to have your visor popped 1 or 2 notches on hot days.Would i buy this again? Well i am, so yeah, and id recommend it to any fans of the comic book or movie series.\n",

      "Ridden with Arai for decades. Bought this because one of my boys is a fan of the Ironman franchise. My first HJC (size XL). Helmet is well built (slightly heavy), the strap is very stiff, and attaching the helmet isn't easy. The interior is a lower quality material, a bit scratchy and quite firm. The shields do as advertised, the yellow is surprisingly effective at highlighting surroundings. The closure is firm (practice opening it with one hand BEFORE you get on the bike). Overall, it feels like a good (not great) helmet. The look will draw the attention of the kids in cars. It is a very good second helmet, but built to a price. Be realistic about what you are purchasing.\n",

      "I usually wear Shoei helmets because they fit my head and are quiet, but I was extremely pleased when I bought this helmet and it was immediately comfy.The looks are fantastic and the fit and finish is great as well. I've had no issues with the graphics getting scratched and all the mechanisms work great a month later. Ventilation is awesome and the noise levels are close to my RF1100. Not quite as quiet, but not far from it. I was skeptical about the amber visor at first, but I love it. Not really as bright in the sun as I expected and I rarely use the drop down sun shield in full sun.The only negative I can give is that there are no speaker cut outs for a intercom system.TL;DR= Great helmet for a great price.

This, combined with the cold graphics, are the extent of the positives.The negatives are the noise, poor spring mechanism on the internal visor, and the easily scratched graphics. It really takes just about nothing for the graphics, the reason you may want this helmet, to get scratched up. Be very careful with where you place it. The wind noise is way above typical even for a value helmet. I get a whistle at normal commute speeds that is very distracting.I also got the Captain America helmet and it is a MUCH better build. I suggest taking a look at that one if you like the Marvel helmets. Punisher looks awesome and is the same helmet as Cap.\n",

      "This is my first motorcycle helmet, and I was a little anxious going with the cheapest option on Revzilla. That said, as a basic intro helmet, this this is pretty great. The visor has some nifty features that I didn't discover until after riding for a few weeks. One is the ability to use the lever on the left side of the face shield to open the shield just a tiny crack. This is great when you're dealing with fogging (I wear glasses, so it's hard to tell if this is the helmet's fault - more on airflow later) and cools things down dramatically on a hot summer day. The noise and aero penalty is not half as bad as riding with the visor up. It fits over my glasses flawlessly.Airflow is pretty bad, or not really noticeable. This is part of why the ability to crack the visor is so important. Even with all the vents open, I don't feel any airflow until I hit at least 45mph. In the summer I just ride with the visor up when I'm doing less than 45.The trade-off is noise. I don't really ride on the freeway with my 250, and noise is not an issue with the visor down, but I get the impression that were I to get up to 80mph, things would get pretty loud. It's a $100 helmet though, and for my purposes this is a minor annoyance.I have a large, oddly shaped head, so I hesitate to comment too much on comfort. Nonetheless, this is the most comfortable helmet I was able to find, and while my forehead does get sore after riding 1hr+ without a break, my primary use is a 30m commute each way and for that it's perfectly comfy.I plan to ride well into the fall in New England so I like the option of adding the pinlock anti-fog visor insert.Overall it's a great budget helmet. Only reason I would ever upgrade would be for something super dope like a Shoei or Arai and I would still have a really hard time justifying the price difference...\n",

Overall I am very pleased with this helmet but it does have a few qwerks (but at less than $100 these are to be expected); when riding with the shield up the helmet whistles, the shield is very basic and fogs easily, riding with all vents open is pretty noisy as well. With that being said it is still a fantastic helmet for the money, if the helmet was $500+ than these issues would have been a deal breaker but not at this price point. The vents on the helmet do work quite well to keep your noggin cool and it is very comfortable and lightweight. This is my primary helmet for now and it will continue to be my back up when I upgrade down the road.\n",

I have a pretty big head with dreads on top of that and this was the only entry level priced helmet that fit without hotspots. Ended up getting a 2xl with in hindsight may be one size too big now that the padding os breaking in but still feel very safe with thos helmet. Pros: cheap, light, comfortable, comes in high vis white, not too loud (unless bent over in sport riding position), removable padding to keep you clean for the life of the helmet. Cons : Only DOT rated, vents could be better, not a ton of padding just bare minimum, no anti-fog coating on the visor so it will fog up in a breath or 2 if youre not driving at least 30mph with the vents open when night riding. Overall id recommend it, just make sure you add some good antifog.\n",

      "Okay.So. What sold me on this helmet was the Snell rating and the FRONT visor lock. I bought a Bell Qualifier with the Tagger Graphics on it brand new from a local store for 180$, got on interstate and both visors i used would fly up above 70mph. Once almost got me killed. So. From then on i decided not to buy any helmet without a lock. And yeah. I junked that helmet and took a loss. I currently used an older model HJC and a high dollar shoei that i had found in pawn shops practically new. Love both of them. That being said.Neither of them have the chin mesh to prevent wind noise.Neither of them have a true face directed vent(yes. Its noticeable and keeps you very cool at 40mph)Neither of them have a front shield lockBoth of them cost more than this one new as well.So. Now. The review for the helmet.The day i got it. I decided to go all out and take a good long ride on interstate and through town.Noticable right away was its weight, my hjc and shoei are both heavier than it, when im going 70-80mph, its much easier to quickly turn my head side to side than both of my old helmets, i mounted my Sena 30k to it, works fine. the helmet feels solid to the touch and squeeze. The visor lock is super easy to use, works great. The shape is super nice, and i love that it has the emergency release system. Its very comfortable and doesnt move around when it breaks in.Now. The bad.The day i got to my destination.I dropped the helmet upon removing it from my head.It fell 6 feet and the back vent cover broke off.The two middle connections to it snapped.BUT.The sides still snapped on, so i snapped it on, and superglued the middle supports back onto it, so my back vents are still covered.All in all.Theres no better helmet for 150$.\n",

      "First helmeti ever purchased for myself. Last helmet i had came with the bike I bought. Sold that bike to buy my house and was finally able to get a new bike. I searched for a while and didn't want to break the bank on a helmet alone since i needed to get all new gear. The helmet looks great and is very aggressive looking. I put the silver mirror visor on it and it looks even better. The helmet is true to size maybe a little small and like most other reviews the check pads are probably the biggest issue. They are tighter than I'd probably like and it feels like they are pushing my cheeks into my mouth. It's not bad just a bit of an annoyance. The front vent could be better in the air flow sense but the top one is good. The visor is a very easy one handed operation along with the built in sunshade is a nice touch and perfect for my prescription glasses. Would highly recommend this helmet.\n",

      "Cons. Measurements called for a medium. The top fits good but is very tight in jawline. Even after break in the jawline is so tight it is difficult to secure it closed and is annoyingly tight. It is not comfortable because it is a tight fit but if you get proper sizing it seems like it would be. With both airflows open I dont feel a difference regardless if I ride with or without the windshield. Riding with visor cracked for extra air raises volume significantly.Pros. Feels well made and has clear visor, no ripples. Visors function well and opening/closing vents is as easy as it gets. Strap is easy on/off. Nice helmet for the money.\n",

      "Great helmet for the money, this is my 2nd modular helmet and that makes it much easier to get on and off and also comes in handy when stopping for gas or while backing the bike up. The shape looks really cool and aggressive you’d never know it was a modular if you didn’t lift it up. I purchased this helmet in the black satellite graphic which looks great, the online pic looks more like a matte finish but it isn’t, it’s bright and shiny which is what I wanted because my last 2 helmets were plain matte black. I also added the silver mirrored shield which makes it look even better and is easy to change out quickly with no tools. The inner drop down visor works well with a gloved hand but the vision out of it seems just a bit distorted. I went with a size medium based on the size chart and it fits perfect, makes me realize my previous helmets were just too big in a size L. I’ve been on a single 5 hour ride in this helmet and it was comfortable the whole way with no pressure points. Also my Sena speakers fit perfect in the cutouts and there was no issue getting it wired up and attached to the helmet.\n",

      "Loving the newer tech for sport touring/commuting on the reg!\n",
      "The year is 2018, and I’ve just bought my 4th helmet. A Scorpion EXO-920.Why did I purchase it? Why for the modular aspects and for riding through various checkpoints and not having to remove my lid to show my face.Things that I like about the helmet include the looks and functionality, not to mention the built in sun visor. I also like the added flexibility of the shell, so that I can put it on without too much fuss with my ears getting folded as it gets pulled on (should also work fairly well for those that have wires hanging out of their ears).Things that I don’t like would have to include the way that my Cardo Systems G4 speakers fit in it. I have to turn it way up to get any sort of sound that I can disseminate through the road noise (please take into account that my daily commute is mostly on the German autobahn, so my speeds are usually up around and sometimes over 100 MPH). Not that it’s really a noisey helmet, but I’ll probably need to try to pack something behind the speakers so that i can hear them better (as in closer proximity to my ears). The other thing that I’d like to try would be the Pinlock visor. My visor, in the cold, seems to fog immediately when taking off on the cold (as in sub 10 Celsius or 50 degrees Fahrenheit) mornings. Once I’m at speed it’s fine. And even then, once I slowdown again, there’s not even a hint of fog. So maybe it’s caused by the cold of the mornings before the helmet adjusts more to the outside temps or something.I am also particularly amazed at the visors clarity. I don’t remember either of my past two helmets being this clear (my last being a Shark RSi Dual Hologram, and the one before that being an Icon Mainframe Halo). Maybe I just didn’t notice, but I’m almost scared of this one. I’ve had to touch it a few times when riding just to make sure that something is still there. But that’s only when I ride with the standard visor. I don’t have that problem with the mirrored visor that I have. Also, visor removal is crazy easy! Not quite as easy as on the Shark, but extremely fairly easy, all the same. Line up is a little tricky, but nothing of major concern. All in all, I'm pretty happy with it, but it was neck and neck between this one and the HJC RPHA 90 & Max, but the newer more modern design build (built more for sport touring and semi tuck position) and the great price made it a no brainer!\n",

      "Doesn't work well with communication speakers\n",
      "When I first got the helmet, I was excited because it was so much more quiet than my old helmet, (A Noland N104) so I figured I would be able to hear through my Sena communicator better.  The noise was the big reason I bought a new helmet.  So I installed the Sena in the Scorpion, and wow, I COULDN'T hear the speaker nearly as well as I could with my old noisy Nolan helmet!!   I was confused! Took a while to figure out why.    The speaker pockets do not center on one's ear inlet.   In fact they place the speaker holes directly over the flat  of my ear flap and no part of the speaker is over my ear canal.   I thought maybe my head is shaped funny (it may be a little ugly but isn't really shaped funny)  so I had a friend try it on.  It didn't go over his ear canal either.    If you look at the design you can see why.   The chin strap mounts are right where the speakers should go.   So when Scorpion added speaker pockets a year or two ago, they put them where they could rather than redesign the whole helmet and put them where they should be.    I tired mounting the speakers out of their pockets, lower and further forward.   I could hear great, but the speakers dug into my ear and it was too uncomfortable to wear for any length of time.   As a result, this Scorpion has been regulated to being a spare, not my regular helmet.   I went back to my old Noland until  I can bring myself to buy another helmet.\n",

      "Just returned from a 4-day, 800+ mile ride through upstate New York (July 12- 15 2018) using the helmet for the first time.This is my first full face/modular so my ratings are based on very limited experience.  I am impressed by the light weight, vision and lack of a sensation of claustrophobia.  The ventilation was great and my head remained cool even in 90 degree temperatures.  The fit was comfortably snug (L) but I did experience some pressure on one side of my head that lasted 30-45 minutes.  Could be due to the standard (thicker) liner so maybe I will try the thinner option.  Chose the matte black color but noted that this helmet is offered in a variety of colors in Europe and other parts of the world.  Would be good if other colors are made available.The acid test of a helmet is how well it protects one's noggin in a tumble.  I'm happy to say that I did not test this.My old helmet is a 3/4 Shoei, which is DoT and Snell approved and I would like to see all helmets conform to the latter standard.For now I am happy with the product and can recommend it.\n",

      "In baseball you have 5 tool players--A player that can hit for a high batting average, for power, runs the bases well, throws well and fields well.The Scorpion GT-920 is the five-tool player in the helmet world. It's comfortable, affordable, protects well, lightweight, feature-rich, and very stylish. This is my first modular and I love it. My last three helmets have been Scorpion and they always over deliver in their features and value.This helmet is great for around town and is quiet enough for touring but I’d recommend you keep that included chin-curtain as that makes a difference in quietness at highway speeds riding an unfaired motorcycle. I ride a white R1200R and I have the white GT-920 and it looks great with the bike. My GF has a white Nolan modular and Nolan’s “white” isn’t really a “white” and Scorpion’s white is more true to color and inviting. In an absolutely perfect world, I’d wish for a KwikWick 4 instead of the 3 that is standard with this helmet. We have had a brutally hot summer in NYC this year and while the KwikWick 3 system works well, I can definitely push the limit of its perspiration absorption features. Replacement shields are inexpensive and have ridden a full year with no need to replace mine. And here’s what drew me to Scorpion helmets some years ago: The face shield DOES NOT Fog! Never…ever…$1200 helmet shields fog but Scorpion manages to sincerely make shields that refuse to fog even in the wort conditions. If you have a million dollars in the bank, maybe buy a different modular but if you want one of the best modular helmets on the market and still have money left over to invest so you can have a million in the bank one day,—this is your helmet!\n",

My large glasses have plenty of room even with the sun visor (which I love), and all the physical functionality is really easy to use even with gloves on.Style-wise, I love the helmet and its clean minimal coloring. I'll probably be sticking with Scorpion for a long time.My only other remark is that the clear visor has begun smudging a little bit already in the first 2 weeks (whether due to fogging breath or stray fingers, I'm not sure). I'll likely have to regularly clean it with a microfiber cloth.\n",

I changed the windshield on the helmet and that helped a little but the whistling is still there.The chin curtain on this helmet refuses to stay on. The left side just pops out with the lightest pull.Like most of the other reviews say; this helmet has very thick padding that makes the helmet very small.

      "Great value and fits me true to size\n",
      "Some other reviewer commented that he'd like to meet the freak-of-nature that this helmet fits true to size. Well hi. Pleased to meet you. I have a decidedly long-oval head and a narrow jaw.My head measures a tad over 60cm making me just over a large based on chart. Based on the complaints of many reviewers here that it ran at least one size small I ordered both my true size large which is rated at 59-60cm and an XL which is advertised as 61-62cm. (Revzilla return handled graciously.)Tried on the XL. Buckled it up. I could tell this was too big. Did the forward rotation test and the brow touched the bridge of my nose. Lateral test and I was able to turn my head. I could easily talk and chew so cheek pads were too loose. Obviously too big.The large was decidedly snug. Buckled it up and rotation test passed. Lateral test passed. Left it on for a while. No hot spots. Slurred speech and lightly bit my inner cheeks when chewing. Fit was spot on.It is my belief that few people actually know how a helmet should fit and are wearing a too large hat. Consider:- If you can chew gum your helmet's too big or wrong shape. - If you can buckle up and forward rotate the helmet so the brow touches your nose your helmet is too big.I just returned from 1,400 mile multi-day varied-weather trip to see the total eclipse and can report it worked well. Not perfect. I found one fit and finish flaw. The head liner has a poorly sewn seam that has a lump that caused an annoying pressure point on my head just behind ears. I carved out a small channel in the EPS that the lump can sit in; seems to be OK now.That leads to one important observation you should keep in mind. Scorpion apparently makes two shell sizes; XS-L and XL-3XL. So all that differentiates a XS from an L for example is the thickness of the pads. Thus if you are an L like I am you get the thinnest pads in the smaller shell whilst if you are lucky enough to be an XL you get the thickest pads in the larger shell.(Note that the pads can be swapped out but only within the shell sizes. So L pads will fit in an M but L pads will not fit an XL etc.)So in conclusion:- Excellent value! Quality construction.- Fits long oval heads true to size IMO. Round heads may want to look elsewhere. Don't size up to fix a bad head-shape match.- Looks great; smaller shell size very light for a flip-up- Anti-fog works as advertised- Ventilation is very good; 95 degrees in South Carolina and felt fine- One of the best integrated sun shields I've had. Just dark enough and optically excellent- Very glasses-friendly- Average noise for a flip-up but I wear hearing protection- Cutouts in ears for comms units (though not very deep so YMMV)- Comes with a removable chin curtain and nose breath guard- Pads quite thin on L whilst luxurious on the XLThumbs up.\n",

      "Awesome Value For the Price\n",
      "I ride more than most and haven't worn a full-faced helmet since my last Shoei about 17 years ago when I had a ZX-7.  Since I switched to a Harley in 2004 I almost always ride without a helmet unless I'm somewhere that requires it by law.  Recently after a few rain showers during rides to and from work, I decided a full-face helmet might be a good idea because my ride is 40 minutes each way and one direction is always at night.I started with the basic internet search and soon found the revzilla site and quickly liked what I saw.  Their website is incredibly user-friendly and their video and customer reviews are ideal for selecting a helmet.So based on my needs and the reviews I went with this helmet and I couldn't be happier with it.  The quality for the price is amazing.  I followed the customer reviews as far as size goes and I'm glad I did.  I normally wear a Large so I went with an XL and it fits perfectly.  It's true, the cheek pads are definitely firm against the face but not uncomfortable.  So it's a perfect fit and slices through the air at 80 mph with very little buffeting.  The field of view is excellent.Compared to the usual helmetless riding I do it's much quieter and allows me to throw in some earbuds and listen to whatever.  The built in sun visor is an EXCELLENT feature and very easy to manipulate with gloves on.  The visor and the modular front are also extremely easy to use with gloves on and while riding.If you buy this helmet and you don't like it the problem is you, not the helmet.  You can't ask for more at this price.\n",

      "I was in the market for a quality and economic modular helmet in summer 2016 and settled on this one. Compared to a few others in the low $200s this was the best choice in my opinion, based on features and reviews. The only big surprise was the shape. I am an intermediate oval head and fit Large in other \"intermediate oval\" helmets. I had to send back my Large GT920 because it was too tight in the forehead. Either I'm more oval than I thought or this helmet is more round than others. The XL was still a bit tight in the forehead (front-back) but broke in well and now feels great. I personally like that the cheek pads are tight, it makes it feel secure.I'm concerned that it has some pretty significant fogging problems in the rain. Too dangerous to ride with the shield closed so I have to leave it partly open during rain and as a result gets pretty soggy inside. Anti fog is pretty weak and sometimes scary. Only other complaint is that it is kinda noisy, but that's expected from an economy modular.Still a pretty good value over all.\n",

      "Excellent mid-price helmet\n",
      "Summary:  I would absolutely recommend the Scorpion GT-920 helmet to anyone looking for a good, budget friendly helmet.  In this mid to low range price point (depending on your personal budget) I feel the GT-920 is an excellent helmet!  Visibility is nice and wide, ventilation is good, the chin bar lock is secure and operates freely with a gloved hand as does the drop down visor, and the noise level is lower than any of my previous helmets.  The fit feels a bit small to the chart, and in the intermediate oval category.Details:  The Scorpion GT-920 replaces my old Nolan N102.  When I purchased the Nolan several years ago, it was close in price to this helmet, around $250.  Prior to that, all my helmets were cheap motorcycle store offroad helmets.  My comparison will be to the Nolan, as the others were basic protection only.Scorpion GT-920 Pros:  •\tThe eye port is nice and wide.  Coming from the Nolan, it was immediately noticeable how much more field of vision I had.  I can see the mirrors without turning my head at all, and at stop signs I can check with much less head turn.  Also makes the over shoulder glances in traffic easier.•\tScorpion’s fog protection does well here on steamy Alabama mornings when the humidity is high.  I run then shower many times before work, and my damp hair used to cause bad fog problems.  This face shield treatment handles that situation without any fog.  Only time will tell the longevity of the treatment.•\tScorpion’s eliptech main visor system locks securely, seals tight against rain, and I bet helps with the low wind noise also.•\tAs far as overall noise is concerned, the GT-920 is significantly more quiet than the Nolan.  I credit the tight visor seal and close chin bar tolerances for this.  Yes, I always wear earplugs, but I can tell a big improvement in wind noise.•\tThe internal visor is very nice!  My Nolan sun shade was external, so that meant it had to be up if the main visor or chin bar were up.  With the GT-920, I can ride with the main visor up in slow town traffic, have good ventilation AND my sun shade down.  Even at the gas pump, the chin bar comes up and the shade stays down.  Really nice upgrade to my commuting riding style.•\tVentilation is good.  The top vent moves more air than the chin vent, but both move enough air for Alabama summers at speed.  I can easily tell when the vents are open by feeling air inside the helmet and I can actuate them easily with a gloved hand.•\tThe GT-920 chin bar locks up tight and operates easily.  Compared to the Nolan, it really is like Anthony says; It feels and is shaped more like a sport helmet with modular features, whereas the Nolan was a bulky modular that was shaped \"sporty\".Cons:•\tIn the mornings, the drop down internal shade has fogged slightly at the bottom, but not up into the primary field of view.  My wet hair situation mentioned above is a real acid test for fogging, so considering that, it's not bad.•\tI too admit the cheek pads are tight.  I'm 6'4\" and weight 165#, so I'm a skinny guy, and on me the cheek pads are snug.  It's not bad now, but I have a full beard in the winter, and I could see it starting to feel tight.  Maybe by then the pad will be compressed a little.  A fuller face person will think they are tight.Notes:  •\tAs to overall fit.  I don't know if this is a pro or con.  So I guess it's just a note.  My head measures 23.5 inches, which is right at the top of the LG size.  I'm always right at the LG/XL transition.  I first ordered a LG and it was too snug.  Hot spots and a headache in about 10 minutes just sitting on the couch.  Returned to Revzilla (excellent and easy return BTW) and got an XL.  The XL fits just right on my 23.5 inch noggin.  •\tThe Scorpion has D-rings which take a few more seconds to open and close compared to the Nolan ratchet, but that’s a personal preference thing, and again neither a pro nor a con. I certainly recommend the Scorpion GT-920 helmet for commuters, sport tourers, and even light adventure tourers.  Heavy offroaders or those dedicated to the “Adventure” look may opt for the AT-950, but I ride a DRZ400s and a Ninja 250 and the GT-920 suites me on both bikes riding on any surface.\n",

They still feel disproportionate to the padding in the crown however (crown is a little loose, cheeks are snug). Also, being a modular, I wouldn't call them cheek pads, I'd call them jaw pads. They don't really touch much of your cheek at all, but end where the hinge of your jaw is. This is where all the pressure from the pads are. Helmet is fairly comfy now that it's all broken in.Airflow/Anti-fog: This is my biggest gripe with the helmet. For whatever reason, there is A LOT of air that comes in behind the visor, even with everything closed. This is the biggest reason the visor doesn't fog badly. It also makes the helmet a horrible choice below around 60 degrees. Riding home from work the other morning, in the low 50's, my eyes were watering pretty good by the time I got home. I ride until the snow starts flying and I'm going to have to abandon this helmet in the fall.Other: Dark Smoke and Stock visors are optically correct. No bubbles or distortion. Can't say the same about the drop-down sunvisor. Has some major distortion near the top of the visor, so if you tuck or semi-tuck a lot, that could be a problem. Finish is pretty good. Matte black looks great, chin bar snaps in solidly. The little strip that holds the chin strap close to the chin strap pad is junk. Started fraying the first day I rode with it. Might have to stitch them together somehow.All in all it's a decent helmet for the price. Was going to go with 3.5 stars, but let it go to 4. Bottom line though, is this helmet isn't good for cooler temperatures. The air in the visor, and lack of pinlock, will only get you so far in the cooler months.\n",

      "I was worried about the noise that people mentioned but I don't notice it at all. It's really nice to swing the front up when I'm causing around town. Only negative is that it's possible to pull the front down and think it's latched, but it don't fully seat unless you put some decent pressure on it. Had it fly up on me once... it's never happened since as I got the technique down but it's something to be aware of.\n",

      "Solid Helmet For The Money\n",
      "Pros:- Lightweight- Comfortable- Drop-down sun visor- Quiet for a modular helmetCons:- Ventilation- A little small- Tight cheek padsOverall, this is a really great helmet!  It's tough to beat for the value you get - the features, the quality, etc.  It's a solid built helmet for a little over $200.  The modular frame (where it separates from the helmet) is very well-done.  It's got metal instead of plastic connection points, as Anthony explains in the video, is important, as it's a potential break point.  It is DOT approved only, and if it were from a less-reputable company rather than Scorpion, it might be a concern.  I had another helmet from Scorpion (T-510 and I recommend that one as well) that I was wearing during a near collision with a deer, where I laid my bike down, and when my head hit the ground, I was just fine.  I feel entirely safe with Scorpion products, and they receive high marks for safety, in my book.The pros are pretty self-explanatory.  The KwikWick ll liner is very nice.  It's anti-microbial, and is easy to wash.  It's comfortable, and is wicking.  The drop down sun visor is also a nice feature.  The visor isn't super-dark, but it does the job, for the most part.  I live in Utah, so we only get blasted with heat really only two months out of the year.  If you live in Arizona or somewhere with stronger sunlight, you might need a darker shield.  For most people, it'll be good enough, though.  The helmet is also very quiet.  I've had it on north of 80mph, and no whistling, and the wind noise is moderate.  At cruising speeds (55-60mph), it's a dream.  I was surprised at how quiet it was, especially for a modular helmet!As for the cons, the ventilation is a bit lacking, to be honest.  If it wasn't a modular, it would be horrible, but in my experience, if it gets too hot, you can always pop up the front of the helmet to cool off.  And it's really only a problem in 85+ degrees.  As for sizing, I fall right in between medium and large sizes, and with going to a medium initially, it was too small, and tight fitting.  Modulars usually run a little smaller, on average, and this one is no different.  If you are near the next size up, just jump up to the next size.  The cheek pads are VERY tight, too.  And they don't loosen up much after use, either.  It isn't uncomfortable, but it is snug.  It's a preference thing, but if you are concerned about it, talk to Scorpion, and they can send out smaller cheek pads.  For me, it's not a problem, and you get used to it with time.If you're looking for a great modular helmet at the $200 price point, you will be hard-pressed to find a better one.  Well done, Scorpion!  And, as always, RevZilla is awesome!  Crazy fast shipping, the their customer service team is second-to-none!  I'll be a customer for life!\n",

      "I have owned 15-20 helmets in over 30 years of riding. This helmet is a great bargain for all the features it offers. It is true to size and comfort level without any added pressure points. I like the cut outs for speakers because I have a SENA 10S installed with no problems. The only drawback that I could find with this helmet is that the upper air vent doesn't create some wind noise when it's open. It's a small price to pay for a Modular helmet with integrated sunshield and cutouts for speakers. Leave the $600 helmets and jus to buy one of these! You will have more money for brewski's and hotel rooms for those long rides!! Scorpion makes a quality product!\n",

The speaker cut outs are in just the right place and worked out well. The helmet is very quiet for a modular. The controls are easy to use once you get use to them. My head measured right between large and extra large so I ordered the extra large which makes the cheek pads not so tight, but as I said and so have others these pads are tight.. Overall this is a good helmet that I hope to enjoy for quite a few years...\n",

      "Only a few rides so far but I really like this helmet.   Having had a scorpion helmet (bought 5yrs ago) I knew they fit snugly in the cheekpads so went with the large size vs medium.  So fit is excellent, great style, drop-shade works well for the Florida sun, relatively light weight.   The very slight distortion from the faceshield bothered me a bit the first couple times out, but since them have noticed it, in fact I'd forgotten about it until I started this review.   In you need a full face helmet this a great one for the money.   (Was considering a Caberg Duke, but the airflow features of the gt-920 made the decision for this an easy one)\n",

      "My first helmet was the Scorpion EXO-CT220, which was the opposite of stylish. I've had this helmet for about two weeks now and this is what I found..Pros:.Style. It's just a cool looking helmet!.I can hear my bike! Sounds crazy, but the back vents somehow funnel the sound from behind me to my little ears. .The modulated portion works great. It's perfect to flip up when you are sitting at a stoplight or want to clearly yell obscenities at your riding partner..No flimsy parts sticking out from the helmet. It is smooth. A lot of modulated helmets have wimpy tabs sticking out for the visor or the vents, etc. this one doesn't. There is pretty much nothing to break off if you accidentally drop the helmet..This helmet doesn't fog! Sweeeeeet..It's easy to clean.Cons:.Anytime I wear it I have a long deep line etched into my forehead. It's slightly annoying..The sun visor is not dark enough for me..The anti-fog nose guard thing makes my chin moist. I don't know if that is normal for a helmet like this but it's a slight incontinence..The dang cheek pads. as others have said they are large and in charge. so when you flip up your visor at the stoplight you look like a chipmunk..At speeds over 60 it whistles. It whistles, just saying..On longer rides this helmet makes my jaw sore.Considering both the pro's and con's I would still suggest this helmet to most anyone who has worn a motorcycle helmet before.\n",

I do have a narrow face and it was still snug. It was very comfortable to wear. The ease of opening the chin bar was impressive. I did struggle to find the ventilation ports but once I knew where they were it was very simple. With this being said i did send it back.

      "I purchased this helmet online after doing a lot of research and reading many reviews. I have an intermediate oval to long oval head. Finding a helmet that fits properly has been a nightmare but I've finally found the one that fits properly with no \"hot spots\". The helmet has a solid feel without being heavy. The padding inside is plush making the helmet tight when you first put it on but quickly conforms to the shape of your head. The cheek pads are quite tight on me and I have a pretty narrow face. I took them out and put them between my matress and box spring for 24 hours...it did compact the plush lining a bit making the cheek pads more comfortable (they were very easy to snap out and snap in). I haven't taken it out for a ride yet but with all the reviews I've read, I'm expecting it to perform well.\n",

What stood out the most is how little head wobble there is, even at high speeds.One of the biggest negatives for me, and it's far from a big issue, is that there are no grooves for glasses too slide into. Without them, the arms just push a little into the side of your head. I've worn the helmet with glasses on for over 2 hours and it's not the end of the world.Buy this helmet, I highly doubt you will be disappointed!\n",

It is safer and more convenient than having to replace the shield or carrying an extra clear one.The modular design is another advantage as I'm not forced to remove the helmet on quick stops.

None the less, the helmet fits great, it may seam a little tight on the cheeks, but not enough to be a discomfort on a 1 hour ride. I can't say much about the wind noise because I wear my sound isolating ear buds and listen to music as I ride. My only concern before I bought it was if my big ol Oakley Currency's were going to fit under the internal dark visor, and I was very fortunate that it did (see pic), it's a very nice feature for someone who doesn't have prescription sunglasses. As for the chin curtain, my face has one already built in, lol. So anti-fog, when it's cold outside and I am at a stand still, it does fog up, so you can either flip it up (either part) or try to blow down from your mouth. Also, maybe I wasn't supposed to remove the rear \"DOT\" sticker, because I didn't notice till I was half way removing it that I was lightly scratching the helmet with my nail. Overall, I am very please with the helmet, I'll for sure buy one for the wife when i save up some more funds.Shipping was super fast, it came out of Las Vegas to Central California in 2 days, fantastic.I don't know why the pictures load sideways.\n",

      "First impression is very good. Granted I am moving from an open face helmet, but so far its much quieter then my HJC.My only complaint so far is its a bit tight in the cheeks. Either it will break in or Scorpion will be coming out the replacement cheek pads soon. I have had my new helmet up to 80 so far and found noise level to be acceptable. I am sure you can find a helmet that is quieter but you'll be spending a lot more $$\n",

      "Just got this helmet yesterday. Haven't yet tried it out on the street but was able to try it on and mount my Sena bluetooth set to it. Love the cut outs fpr the headphones. And the bluetooth mounted perfectly which i was a little worried that it might not fit correctly. Awesome looking helmet for a modular. Very agressive design. Little tight in the cheek area. First time ordering from revzilla and I'm very pleased si far of the service. Took about 7 days from ordering to my front door which is awesome for free shipping.\n",

      "Replacing an old HJC CL-17 I don't have a lot to compare this to. Overall this feels like a much higher quality helmet. My head measurements were right between a small and medium so I went with the small and ordered the 31mm cheek pads which still provide a very snug fit.The main issue with this helmet for me is the wind noise. I ride an 883 Iron (no windscreen) so it is possible it has more to do with my seating position. The wind noise is very loud above 50mph so I'm planning on getting the ear pads to see if that helps or not.\n",

      "This helmet fits great, it looks amazing, and it looks badass. I have tried on several helmets and none of them felt right for the fact that some felt loose and others felt too tight on my head. I measure at 55 1/2cm for my head. But, even the small helmets felt uncomfortable. I tried the medium version of this helmet and it felt amazing. However, it also comes down too the brand of helmet. This particular helmet was a bit too pricey, but I am confident that it will do its job should it ever have to. Which, knock on wood, it never has to. I would highly recommend this helmet.

      "This is my fourth helmet, but I hope that it is my last (until it needs to be replaced).  I've gone through helmets in the past, primarily because of the 2XL size of my melon, which is a little longer than intermediate oval.  This Dedicated helmet fits absolutely perfectly.  It's comfortable and sits well on my head.  I find Shoeis to be a littel difficult to put on as it is a very tight squeeze into the helmet, even with the sides of the helmet splayed by pulling on the chin straps.  However, once the helmet actually slips on, it is an absolutely perfect fit.The helmet rides well and has good airflow.  I like the fact that it comes with a removable chin baffle -- I've got it on now, but if it gets too weird with my long beard, then I can easily remove it. I dig the whole PinLock concept.  So far, so good, in terms of visibility and fog reduction.  I'm curious about the Transitions face shield and may opt to pick up one later this summer.  Overall fit and finish of the helmet is superb, and I really dig the distressed flag graphic.  The helmet just as this feel of solid quality, which is reassuring.  After having gone through Schuberth, Arai, and Bell helmets in the past, I'm happy to have landed on this beautiful Shoei.  In all fairness, the Arai RX(?) I still have and will continue to use as it is also a high quality and comfy helmet (in hi-viz yellow), but the Shoei definitely feels more comfortable.  The others: just couldn't get them to fit or wear well, and so they have been sold.All in all, a great helmet that is sharp looking, comfy, solidly reassuring, and most importantly for us big 2XL guys, one that fits perfectly.\n",

The face shield is hard to move and why does Shoei insist on their label being so big. The speaker also touches my ear, which is annoying and it can't go any deeper as the cut out does not allow for the cord edge to drop into the recess. Counting the transitional shield and the radio I have $1100 into this an am a bit disappointed.\n",

Comfortable to wear, not so much to ride in. this was the loudest helmet I ever wore. My ears took a beating over 30 m.p.h.  This completely negated all the praise I gave it for comfort. I have to wear earplugs even with all the vents closed. I wore a HJC rpha12  before this, and never experienced any issues with wind noise...not to mention it was a few hundred dollars cheaper. .

      "Huge upgrade over the previous helmet, Icon Airmada. I initially avoided this since I thought it wouldn't fit my head, Icon Airmada I wore 3XL, and this helmet does not come in that size, went to Revzilla store and tried on this helmet in 2XL, fit so much better.Comfortable, quieter, much better airflow, I couldn't feel any air flowing over my head with Icon Airmada, but with this, I way more airflow cooling my hot head.Durability, I haven't crashed so cannot comment here, but due to lack of clearcoat, the matte surface is prone to marking.The picture of the helmet does not do justice, the right side of the helmet has a white flag with a grey SHOEI logo. Opposite color of the left side. Looks much nicer in person.The only regret is not getting one several years ago.\n",

The LG fits perfect on my 23.5\" melon and the liner is very soft.My only cons are airflow sun visor tint.  Without the pinlock the shield will fog up instantly.  It can also get warm, at a stop or slow speeds, pretty fast, but lifting the shield up to the first notch solves that.

The SRL system works really well, except that I can't get it to connect to a Shuberth Bluetooth system.I dislike the lack of the tiny lever at the side of the visor, like my RF1100.  The first open setting for the visor opens the visor about an inch,and that's too much. What is needed is the little lever on the side like the RF1100 which opens the visor ever so slightly, just enough for a tiny bit of air flow.  This is the only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars.\n",

Airflow is good, but I would like the chin curtain to be more easily removable or an adjustable design, this helmet can get hot if you're in a lot of stop and go traffic.  Modular opens easily and closes assuringly.  Pinlock is a nice bonus.  The padding on the head is sort of \"ribbed\", such that I always have bad helmet hair when I remove if after a 30-minute commute to my office job. My guess is the padding is designed for improved airflow. A friend recommended a helmet liner which I haven't tried yet.  Love the chin strap (never going back to D-rings)\n",

      "First of all, I have purchased helmets from Revzilla but this one I did not because it wasn't available from them when I was shopping for one. However, I use Revzilla regularly and wanted to leave a review on this helmet.This is my second high-end modular helmet.  Shoei has never fit me well until this helmet but I liked the graphics so much I tried one on.  I'm not sure if they've changed their headform or if this is a different shell but the fit on this helmet has been excellent from the first day.  No hot spots, tight fit around the head and neck but no pinching.  The optics are excellent and on par with my previous (don't want to compare brand names but) German helmet.  I actually like the sun-visor mechanism better on this helmet.  The wind visor has a very positive ratchet system and I also really like the stainless chin clip.  The helmet has a very beefy chin bar and isn't the lightest but on my bike at least there is no buffeting or neck fatigue.  The liner is very comfortable and the cheek pads provide a nice hug but don't press too hard.  Noise-wise it's on par with other modulars I've worn.  They aren't quietest no matter what the manufacturer advertises.  I wear ear plugs most of the time so it isn't an issue anyway.I use the helmet almost every day because I commute in it.  I've ridden about 1500-2000 miles with it and I still really like it.  In really heavy rain the visor leaks very slightly but unless it's really pouring it keeps the water out.The one thing I wish was different is the narrowest setting on the visor leaves a lot of room between the helmet and visor.  If it's cold and/or wet Mother Nature marches right in.  It would be helpful if the helmet had another position between locked and this position - one that would engage the gasket at the top of the visor but not close it completelyIf you're looking for a really nice helmet and Arai's or Schuberth's have fit you well, give this a try.  Those lids have always fit me well when Shoei did not, until now.  The helmet gets a lot of positive comments and is extremely comfortable.  I can say it's one of the nicest ones I've owned.\n",

Other than that, the helmet fits true to size for me, very comfortable especially in the interior lining and pads.

      "I've never owned a flip-up helmet before, and always thought they kind of gimmicky, until I had to give up two-wheelers due to an injury and bought a CanAm Spyder.  Being on essentially a touring bike, I decided the convenience of being able to have a bite to eat and drink from a water bottle out-weighed the nerd factor for me.  After waiting for almost six weeks for this helmet to come in stock a Revzilla, I broke down and bought it on Amazon (sorry, guys -- couldn't wait any longer).  Was it ever worth the wait, tho!  Best fitting helmet I've owned, although I'm ordering a thicker top pad to tighten it up a bit.  Great looks (I got the Excursion in Matte black/grey), adequate ventilation, acceptible weight (it is heavier than any of my Bell RS-1/Star sportbike helmets).  Just purchased the Sena SRL integrated comm system to complete the deal.  Now if they would only come out with a Transitions faceshield, like they have for the RF-1200 (and Bell has for the RS-1 and Star), I would be a completely happy camper!  Highly recommended.\n",

While on the scale it might weigh a bit on the heavy side, while actually riding it felt significantly lighter to me than my original Neotec. I got the Excursion in gray, red and matte black, and to me it is a very sharp looking helmet.  As always with Shoei products, fit of components, finish, operation and paint are all top-notch.  While at first the liner felt a little scratchy, after a few hours or riding it now feels as soft and luxurious as my original Neotec has for the last 5 years.  In general, it meets or exceeds the helmet it is replacing in all ways.  There are a couple differences;  The chin vent flows well, and won't dry out you eyes with a hurricane blast like the original does. Helmet crown airflow is better, and did not increase noise levels on my bike. Other than that, it is much like the original.

      "Neotec II : A Good Update\n",
      "The original Neotec did not fit my XL head well, and it felt somehow cheap. I didn't care for it. The Neotec II seems to be a completely new design, and it functions and fits (me) well. I can live with the few noted gripes, and I believe that it is a safe and well made helmet. But if I lived in a hot region of the U.S.A., I might hesitate to buy one.I gave it a moderate bang-for-buck score because it is already an expensive helmet that stretches my value sensibility, and the single hi-vis color is another $100 more.My Features rating suffers due to ventilation hardware/function, the chin strap implementation, and the chore of removing the visor. I like D-rings, but I came to prefer a ratchet mechanism on my Nolan helmets. If only Shoei had done as well. Ventilation. The part that mostly works is the front chin bar vent. It snaps open (or closed) with a touch and air streams up the visor into your eyes. Today was hot so it was welcome, but if it had been cold air my eyes would have teared up. There is no adjustment: it is full blast or nothing. If you want just a faint breeze you cannot just open the visor a bit–it is either closed, or open to the first position, which is too far. The top vent is difficult to operate underway, especially with gloves, but it really doesn't seem to matter anyway: when fully open you get a vague sense of something like comfort, but I would not call it airflow. The chin bar is doing all of the flowing that you will feel.In sunshine you get a greenhouse effect in the visor/face area, and there is not enough airflow to provide relief, this even with the sun visor in protective position.Most helmets have a few things about them that you would prefer to see implemented differently. My gripes with this helmet can be accommodated, but it astounds me that a company like Shoei puts a ventilation system like this on a nearly $800 helmet. As noted, I live in a place that doesn't get very hot in the summer, so I will do fine, and I will enjoy the helmet a lot.Shoei makes a great helmet and that really is a bottom line thing for me.\n",

The overall fit is really good, love the idea of the SENA integration and it's the lightest/best field of vision I've had in a helmet so far.Unfortunately the shield does not seal correctly. I have tried adjusting multiple times and tested based on directions from Shoei - no luck. I'm not sure if it's because of the shield or the seal - but lots of noise. In fact it's so bad the noise is less with the shield open up to 65 MPH rather than closed. This is literally the loudest helmet I have owned in 40 years. However, this may be a warranty issue as opposed to a design issue which I'll try and resolve with Shoei. Just disappointing that I'm having this issue with a helmet at this price level.\n",

      "I am a big fan of Shoei and in particular the Neotec. Five on the shelf. I like a lot of things about the new Neotec 2. Paint, airflow, noise and overall design including intercom capacity if you use one. Where they missed the mark they missed large. The face shield design. First, the minimum closing distance is 1\" whereas the standard Neotech shield has more ratchets increasing flexibility and the minimum distance is 1/2\". This spacing flexibility is important to airflow and bad weather. Second, they used the face shield design similar to the RF1200, a pure sports bike helmet. A very different design vs. the angle of a modular helmet. This shield has a large double seam along the bottom. This is fine when completely closed as Shoei recommends but when open to it's minimum height of 1\" it directly interferes with the vision of your instrumentation. I ride with my helmet cracked open 50% of the time. Shoei expects you to ride 100% close, per their manual. How do you ride?\n",

      "Admittedly this is my first Premium Helmet.  My frame of reference was limited to garden variety models, such as the HJC IS-17 and IS-Max 2.  I've admired the original Neotec and some other premium lids from afar. But, while if fit the most comfortably, I was ultimately deterred by its heft.  Recently I've been itching for a new (premium) bucket, as there has been a spate of premium modulars making way to the market.  I've been anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Neotec II to finally make my purchase decision.  Just the week before last, my local bike shop got a demo copy of the Shoei, but, sadly in a size large.  Alas, I'm a medium, but the interior appeared to have similar materials and fit as the original.  The quality of the finish, function and fitment were excellent.  And I appreciated the seamless electronics integration of the Sena SRL.  Color me impressed...  Whilst still comparatively heavy, all in all, the (ahem!) scales tipped in the direction of finally pulling the trigger on the purchase.  I've since been wearing out the Revzilla website constantly checking in several times a day to order my very own personal copy of the Neotec 2, Black/Grey Excursion in a size Medium. Last Wednesday it became available and I hit the order button!  Thanks to Revzilla's lightning fast order processing, Yay, I had it on my doorstep Friday, just in time for the weekend.  Donning my brand new lid, my wife and got out on 'Roxy' ('16 HD Softail Breakout) for a day trip.  We didn't even  make the first stop sign  before I realized I wearing something special, and also kicking myself for not getting something better sooner!  Wow, so bloody quiet.  I mean, I am out in the wind by not having a windscreen, and of course the roar of the pipes and all.  By quiet, I mean I liken it to, you're in the house with someone watching TV in the living room and then closing the door to your bedroom.  Also, it is very slippery out in the wind, even on head checks. I noticed straight away my head wasn't bobbling about as before.  I mentioned it to my wife at our first gas stop.  She started taking notice and said my head was definitely more still.  The ultimate testament was that after a whole day of riding my neck didn't feel strained and oddly felt rather refreshed once getting home.  So while it is heavier than my IS-17 I'm actually less stressed then before?!  I'm a eyeglasses wearer, my specks slipped right into the reliefs in the liner.  Plus I used the internal sun visor most of the day.  As the day wore on and the evening light began to fail, I retracted the sun visor.  Upon doing so I finally felt across my forehead what I'd been missing all day -- ventilation!!  Hmmm...  So to make sure I wasn't imagining I dropped the sun visor again. Things got still.  Retracting it, I felt the air flowing...  So that is about my only niggle regarding the Shoei Neotec II.  Ride Strong...\n",

      "Neotec 2 Excursion Black Hi-vis. XXL. I'm a touring rider living in Wyoming. For me an evening ride is 90-100 miles, Weekend day ride 250-350, traveling day 450-550. Riding Goldwing 1800 or BMW 1600GT.I've been riding 49yrs so I've seen a few helmets. I was looking for a helmet with the features of this one.   First the very good.The construction and finish on this helmet is high quality. The graphics are really nice. The chin bar release is very easy to use and has a lot of room in front of your mouth and chin. I really liked the extra room there. The face shield detents are nice and firm and the view is wide. The sealing gaskets are nicer looking than I've seen on any helmet. The drop down sun shield moves very smoothly is very easy to find and use and feels like there is a slight locking action at the full up position. It comes down and provides great coverage with only a small gap at the bottom while at the same time leaving plenty of room for my glasses and did not hit my nose.The vents are simple to use. Chin open or closed. The top open middle and closed.I really like the chin strap ratchet. it is very secure but will take a little practice to hit the slot every time.The weight of this XXL is 4.3lbs. WITHOUT comm's as compared to my XXL Aria Signet Q WITH J&M comm's at  4.1lbs on my digital fish scale. So for me the extra weight would be worth the features.This is a true intermediate oval fit and true to the size chart. I am slightly long oval and this helmet fit me very well with the exception of the hot spot I get on the top front of my forehead with this shape. I could have worked on the EPS a little and made it fit ok.As for the inside. the cheek pads, forehead, top sides, and neck padding are comfortable with a nice feel to them. The closer fitting neck roll sealed around my neck without feeling tight or binding. The top padding however had a different nap to it and I found it to feel uncomfortably rough against my thinly hair covered scalp. I tried my thin BMW helmet liner and it seamed to solve the problem.Now the disappointingThe left side of the chin bar will not latch. It has a cable to open it and a return spring to close it. there is no adjustment. The cable has a crimped termination and it is just a little short to let the latch close around the pin. This is not a design flaw just a quality control problem. The right side latches securely. The top inside padding should be plush at this price point. Maybe Shoei just needs to hire a couple bald helmet testers.When you pay premium prices you expect premium performance. That's the reason for the 3 star rating.Overall I would say this is a very nice well thought out and functional helmet and a good value for the price. If your looking for the features of this helmet and are an intermediate oval shape I would give one a try.Just wearing this around the house @ 73F with all the extra sealing for quietness it seemed this thing could run a little on the warm side. But since I am returning it I did not ride in it. So I hope someone who rides it behind a full fairing will comment on that. One last observation. The bottom back of this helmet seems to stick out a ways when it was on my head. It may be to help keep the rain from running down your neck, or for aero dynamics, or just to make room for the head set battery. But my first thought was in a slide on your back under the right circumstances it could catch on something. Guess well all just have to cowboy up and not get bucked off so we don't have to find out.    .\n",

      "I bought this helmet because not many superhero graphics come in 3XL. The fit and finish are amazing. The graphics are on point. The venting is second to none. Only issue is it’s loud. Like super loud. Like can’t hear my Cardo on loud with the new speakers loud. Could be because I’m going over 120+ mph, but the air flow underneath the helmet is so loud you cannot hear anything but wind rushing inside of the helmet. Almost a 10/10, but the wind noise brings it down to earth.\n",

I’ve been getting a lot of compliments on it, even some of my rider friends are low key envious that I have the most bad ass helmet in the group. I love the print on the helmet and gow it’s turning a lot of people’s heads. Putting the coolness aside, this helmet is a perfect fit for people in between like me, with heads in between being round and oval, it is super difficult to find a helmet in the right fit. The view inside is awesome, and it works with the loudness of my motorcycle (it’s super loud) bringing it down a few notches, still I use ear protection plugs. In conclusion, from all the helmets I’ve worn, this is my third one and it has given me the best bang for the buck I spent. The reviews in this website is the best and it has helped me out a lot and I can’t wait to see what other kinds of gears I’m going to get. This helmet is definitely a great buy for it’s price.\n",

      "Better than GT Air II\n",
      "I purchased both the Shoei GT Air II and this so I could try them on. From all the reviews, I was thinking the GT Air II would blow the EXO out of the water in terms of build quality. NOT SO.I'm a machinist by trade and I have very expensive tastes. I know quality. The aluminum visor latch on the EXO is far superior to the plastic tab on the Shoei. The matte carbon fiber looks great. It's not perfect (which is a good thing) and makes it look like real carbon fiber, not the bullshit plastic that everyone else uses. This is 3K carbon. The Shoei produced a slight whirl, but was overall a tad quieter. This was about the only thing the Shoei did better than the Scorpion. Air Flow is amazing on the scorpion and the vent controls are very easy/intuitive to operate. The internal sunglass sucks on both models. It warps your vision and while the Shoei comes down a bit farther, I wouldn't use either. Use sunglasses, which by the way, are far more comfortable to use on the Scorpion. The Shoei would make them ride too high on the bridge of my nose. Like, not even close. Speaking of comfort, the pads Scorpion uses are AMAZING! They almost feel like an silky airplane pillow. This is one of the features that really suprised me over the GT Air II. I really liked the comfort of the scorpion better than the Shoei. I ended up taking the Scorpion logo off the front of the helmet as I think it looks a little tacky but other than that, i've loved this helmet! I still wear earplugs (riding a naked bike) with this helmet and have a Sena 20S that works well with it. The Scorpion cuts through the air pretty well and doesn't make my neck get stiff after long rides. All in all, I really like this helmet.\n",

      "This ST1400 CF helmet looks great. It behaves very similar to my 3 year old EXO 900 or 920 flip-up, with a very similar fit, and is about 1/2 lb. lighter than the flip-up. It seems pretty stable at speeds (well) over 100 and comfy cruising at 80-90. I ride a ZX14R so my head is in the \"breeze\". I was hoping for this one piece CF to be slightly quieter than my Scorpion flip-up. It seems about the same. If it was quieter, I would give this helmet a perfect 5 stars. The price is reasonable and the reviews are as good or better than more spendy CF helmets. I would recommend this helmet.\n",

      "Average With QC Issues\n",
      "Bought the helmet after a glowing review from Fortnine.  The helmet arrived and at first glance it's a really nice looking helmet. Lets start with the pros.  It IS light, it IS comfortable, and it IS true to fit.  The pump up pad system is great also. Now lets talk about the cons, my helmet had QC issues.  The visor latch was completely off center which was noticeable and threw off the whole look of the helmet, The internal visor doesn't drop down nearly far enough to the point I wouldn't even call it a feature because if you use it then it will be in your line of vision.  Overall the craftsmanship felt sub par almost cheap. The air vents wiggled when you open or closed them and the visor felt unstable when opening and closing. It wasn't what I was expecting.  If you exclude the QC issues I had then it might still be ok at the price point for what it is. If it wasn't carbon fiber I wouldn't say that.  The made in China sticker probably has a lot to do with these issues. I ended up returning and bought a Shoei RF-SR.  Everything about the Shoei screams quality.  This visor feels great opening and closing, the air vent latches give positive and firm feedback. The Shoei in every way screamed better workmanship.  It is heavier but not so much so that the better quality isn't worth it. If you MUST have carbon fiber i'd suggest one of the more expensive ones.\n",

Under 5lbs but over 4.5 I didn’t even get it on the road because I was returning it for a different brand modular that was less expensive and almost TWO POUNDS LIGHTER! If you have neck or spine issues It’s definitely not lightweight in my opinion..

But just get some headphones or earplugs and you can wear this thing all day.\n",

      "Great Overall Helmet\n",
      "The looks are killer, the carbon weave is beautiful. Very lightweight. Fit is good. My head perimeter is 57.5 cm and size large is fine. The vision is great, excellent peripheral view, could wish for a little more vertical aperture but it is more than adequate. Noise suppression is very good at speeds below ~50 mph. Above 50-55 mph you begin to get a lot of wind rush noise from the bottom of the helmet. Inflating the bladders helps muffle the sound somewhat. If I use additional foam earplugs for long rides, the helmet is very quiet. There is a slight, high frequency noise in the right side at >65 mph. I don't know what it's from, it's not too annoying, but it is there. It is very aerodynamic, no buffeting at all at hyper speeds. Scorpion did a good job on this. Ventilation is only adequate. The controls are easy to manipulate with gloved hands, but I had hoped for more airflow especially at highway speeds. In the city if you're stopped in traffic, you have to open the face shield to get some relief from the heat. That brings up the face shield release... it sucks. When you crack the shield you get this big obstruction right in the center of your vision. I didn't think the center-mounted release catch would be a problem, but it is really annoying. Scorpion, put the release on the side of the shield like everyone else. The drop-down sun visor is a nice touch, the control is accessible with a gloved hand, there is only a slight distortion from the visor.  Overall, a very good helmet. If Scorpion moves the shield release to the side, improves the ventilation, and maybe cuts down on the high speed noise, this would be an all-pro helmet.\n",

      "This helmet  fit my head better than anything else I have tried. I found that the large fit the shape of my head best but I went up one size in cheek pads. The 25mm pads felt ok but they pushed my cheeks into my teeth a bit too much. The 30mm still fit snug but was a bit more comfortable. The 3 snap cheek pads were easy to change, but I had some trouble getting the small clip to engage in the bottom edge of the helmet. Thanks to the Revzilla tech team for getting me there. The price is unbeatable. I hope the safety factor is up to speed.  I liked the helmet enough to buy a second one for my wife.\n",

      "I have a hard time finding a helmet that will fit my head shape. I am somewhere in between an intermediate and long oval so finding a helmet is a challenge. I'm also right on the line between large and x-large.I went to my local shop and tried on just about every helmet that had and the CS-R3 fit fairly well. Needless to say the parts guy was not much help with getting me what I wanted so I walked out the door. I did not want to buy any other helmet they were trying to push on me.I ended up ordering the helmet from Revzilla in a large and it arrived within a few days. It fit good but felt a little tight so I wore it around the house for an hour and figured I would take it for a ride the next morning. After a 40 mile ride I had the typical pressure point pain in my forehead. I then went on a 200 mile ride several days later and the pain was there most of the ride. I decided to try a different liner so I ordered the x-large helmet liner from Revzilla and I swapped it out right away when it arrived. Now the fit of the helmet is awesome, still has a bit of wind noise but it fits me so much better. No more forehead pain.I have done around 5-6 rides with it like this and I am now comfortable. Not sure how many of you have the same issue I do when helmet shopping and I'm hoping this may help if you do.\n",

It really helps seal the sound and the detense was also good.Even though this helmet is really cheap, it has features of a high quality helmet.

Don't think that because this helmet is in a budget is some cheap product, this helmet is made with the manufacturing quality that characterize HJC. The only modification I did to the helmet is that I replaced the clear face shield with a new face shield Dark Smoke HJC CL-09, now my helmet looks way cooler. I will totally recommend it!!\n",

I initially ordered a Large, returned it, and ordered an XL. The large felt slightly too tight, although the XL is slightly too big. In retrospect, I should have kept the large, and ordered thinner interior pads/lining for the best mix of comfort and safety. Either way, helmet is comforatable, and the matte black looks modern and cool. The helment vents best when cracked open one or two positions, but starts to get loud past 40 miles an hour. Kudos to the Revzilla team who helped me order the correct smoke face lense and pinlock sheild.\n",

I had an urgent need to replace.  The shop I stopped at was more off road oriented but had a few of these HJC CS-R3s.  Fortunately one fit (like a glove) was very reasonably priced and got me back on the road.  I wore it for over 500 miles and this will now be my go to helmet.  It has encouraged me to consider other HJCs as well - Keeping price point in perspective this is a great helmet for the money\n",

      "I have owned two other HJC helmets so I am familiar of how it fits my head. My measurement is right in between the medium and large size. My previous helmets were size large which seemed to be comfortable but made me look like a bobble-head because it was huge on me. I went with the medium this time, and although it felt a little snug on me, this is actually the correct and proper size for my head. Now, the helmet looks a little more proportioned to me. The styling looks good. I purchased the solid white color and removed the dark smoke (HJC-09) face shield from my old helmet and it snapped right into place.I plan on making this my motovlogging helmet. It's nice to see cut-outs on the inside to accommodate for speakers of a wireless/bluetooth system. The smooth, slightly rounded, outer front chin area should be able to accommodate the necessary mounting plate to place my action camera. For the price, the helmet is pretty decent with good features and protection. If your budget is on the smaller side like mine, this is one helmet that offers solid performance at a budget-friendly price.\n",

      "This helmet is very light weight, looks awesome, great quality without braking into the $600+ range, has the tinted drop-down inside. They mentioned that the vents are hard to operate with gloves on, but I haven't really had any issue with they, though you have to pull more to the side than straight up on them which takes some getting used to. I only have 3 negative things to say about this helmet. First I would have liked the look better had the AVG emblem been dark, like the helmet is flat black, and it would have looked a lot better had the emblem been either a dark shade of grey, or gloss black. Second, the chin strap while very comfortable is much more narrow than other helmets I have had in the past making it more difficult to loop with gloves on, and the snap to keep it from flapping in the wind is on it's own separate tab so you have to put your thumb behind it to get it to snap (a very minor complaint overall). Last and the biggest one is the chin curtain that comes with it does not come back near far enough. It needs to be about 3/4\" to 1\" longer. It lets tons of wind in making it very loud as is. THAT SAID I modified a chin curtain off another helmet which does go back much farther, and this baby is super quiet now. One last thing I would like to point out is their sizing is much larger than other helmet brands (or at least Icon's). I would advise getting the size you normally wear, and the size smaller, try them both on, and then send back the one that doesn't fit right. All in all fantastic helmet, just needs a better chin curtain really. As it is I would give it 4 stars, but easily a 5 star helmet if you go the extra mile to put a better chin curtain in it.\n",

      "This is a very high quality helmet, and well worth $400 + graphics. I will list my pros and cons below. As for sizing, my head shape is borderline long/intermediate oval, and the helmet fit without issue. My head size is 57.5cm and I bought the Medium-Small. You really have to put on the helmet with the chin at a downward angle to get the right fit. At first I was wearing it similar to other upright-riding helmets, and it was hurting my ears as well as being less comfortable. When fitted properly, your eyes are not in the middle of the visor as is usually recommended - they're a bit higher up. This makes the dropdown sun visor work perfectly, but means this is NOT a track helmet. Your visibility is definitely limited in the full tuck due to the top edge of the visor. The K5-S is a great helmet for a fairly neutral riding position though, which I was fairly surprised about since Anthony said otherwise in his video review. I guess I disagree with ya there, Booch.PROS- Phenomenal quality for the price range.- Very stable in the wind. This was important to me. The hawkbill slices through the air and gave me real stability in the upright and 3/4 riding positions. I haven't had any trouble doing shoulder checks either.- The visor detents are extremely solid and feel expensive. - Pinlock included in the box (not installed).- Sun visor works great and has a decent mechanic. - This sucker is LIGHT! Not as light as some of the full carbon helmets, but it still feels great in the hands and on the head.- AIRFLOW. With all vents open, this helmet flows a ton of air. I also didn't have any trouble opening the eyebrow vents like another reviewer mentioned. I was able to open them with gloved hands my first time riding with it.- The helmet is quiet when all the vents are closed... this is also a negative below.CONS- Okay, first thing. There is a very small, hard part of the liner stitching that sticks out in the center of the forehead. It's situated at the front vent cutout of the liner, and looks like a triangle - find it before you put on the helmet!  I have no idea why it's there, as the rest of the stitching is straight. This thing was like a razor blade though, and the first time I yanked this helmet over my head it cut a nice vertical line down the top of my forehead. Take a pair of scissors and snip that bastard off.- The little tab that cracks the visor for city riding is a silly idea, and not the easiest to use either. This feels like the cheapest part of the helmet, as there is very little feedback when it opens and closes (a bit hard to use with gloves).  I would rather have a normal detent to crack the visor.- I wasn't really a fan of the chin vent control being inside the helmet. It's right above the chin curtain, so you pretty much can't use it while riding. Hey AGV, how about you replace the weird city detent with an exterior vent switch? The style of the helmet would remain exactly the same.- Remember how I said the helmet is quiet with all the vents closed? Well, it's the opposite when they're open. The airflow is great, but it comes with the tradeoff of added wind noise (and lots of it). There's also a slight whistling noise when the wind catches a vent just right, but it's so loud as to be overbearing. On a cool day in the city I forego ear plugs, but during the summer with the vents open you'll definitely need them.Overall, I definitely recommend this helmet. I talked more about the negatives than the positives in this review, but that's because Anthony already does a great job covering the positives in his videos. Make no mistake: this is a fantastic road helmet for $400. For touring and commuting you need to consider the K5 S.\n",

      "I've been using this helmet since January 2017 and I love it! I ride in all weather conditions here in central Texas. Even when its 110 degrees out, its not an oven. When its freezing out, its nice and warm. With the Pinlock screen on the visor, there is zero fogging in the cold weather. I was rear-ended at a red light on 3 November 2017, and the helmet preformed flawlessly when I hit the pavement! I will be buying another AGV K5-S.\n",

      "Alright, first off want to thank Revzilla for the amazing customer service and answering the ungodly amount of emails I sent this about this helmet before making my purchase. You guys are greatTo business. Okay, this is an incredible helmet. It fit like a glove directly out of the box, extremely comfortable. It's bad, it's sexy, it has the hawk bill, it's an AGV. Let's break it down.Ventilation: the amount of air flow with this is incredible. Sometimes during the ride I would almost want to close the vents, it felt like I had no visor on. It was glorious. Compared to some of my last helmets (Icon Variant, Shoei Qwest, and Bilt Techno), this helmet has by far the nest airflow.Comfort: Like I said, dream fit out of the box. I measured out at the MS, and it was spot on with the size guide. I can shake my head around like a madman and no movement at all, while it still doesn't create mad pressure on my head.While riding: Extremely quiet helmet, given the amount of air flow. No buffeting, even with shoulder checks. This is the most aerodynamic piece of marvel I've ever had the pleasure of riding with. Cons: here's the problems I discovered with this marvel. I find I'm looking through the very top of the visor, which makes 3/4 to tuck position mildly uncomfortavle, given the fact that it's hard to see, which to most people, myself included, not being able to see properly is a problem. Field of vision however is flawless. Upon putting my bluetoth piece in (Sena 10s), I had some crazy pressure points on my ears, which is to be expected as I through it all together in about thirty-seven seconds. All in all, I love this AGV, I'll definitely purchase these until I find something better qualified to protect my head. Think I'll be hard pressed, though. For $400, you cannot beat this helmet.\n",

      "Good value for the helmet, aggressive style... a little big\n",
      "I like the AGV K-5 Helmet in terms of price / value, style, and general features. I've been riding in this helmet for nearly a year and have about 5,000 miles in it. I am wearing a ML / Medium-Large shell. The Medium-Small is just a bit too tight, front-to-back... and, of course, the Medium-Large is just slightly too large. I like the 4-shell size concept, but still managed to fall in between two sizes. That has more to do with my head than the helmet.With respect to sizing - the shell size isn't unusually large, but it looks like I'm wearing the King Jack (Jack-in-the-Box) head (I have a white helmet). The size of the helmet seems large and catches a fair amount of wind. Any head-checks tend to pull on the chin of the helmet, probably due to the hawks bill shape. I deal with it. Also, the venture effect over the top of the helmet is interesting... it pulls pretty good - so make sure you're strapped down snugly. The vents... It is almost impossible, under any condition, to open the eyebrow vents. As I live in a somewhat cooler climate, they're closed 80% of the time. But, trying to go from closed to open is a real bear. When open, I get decent airflow, so don't really have a complaint about the actual ventilation.The noise isn't bad or unusual, really - but it's not a super quiet helmet. To be honest, I'm not sure what a super quiet helmet would sound like, as I've never really put a helmet on and thought \"wow, it's like a library in here.\" I ALWAYS ride with foamies in the ears and that cuts down on a lot of noise... but, it's still plenty noticeable.The interior of the helmet, as far as padding is concerned, etc. is pretty comfortable - I like it. because the size of the helmet is just slightly too large for me, I don't get much pinching on longer rides. Overall the padding is comfortable and comes out easily - and like all helmets, takes a little work to get it back in, but nothing excessive or frustrating. The shield mechanism locks and unlocks easily so shield changes are pretty easy. I don't really care for any drop-down visors, as they never seem to go low enough and I get a line through my vision where the visor ends. The actuator is pretty easy to reach and works easily - so if you like the drop-down visor, it will work fine for you. I go with shield changes... the smoke / mirrored shields are not cheap, but also not heart-stoppingly expensive. The double-d ring strap is very secure - as you would expect - and I have no problem with it... it seems to hit the right spot on my chin, so I don't get choked. Once it's on - I forget about it, so I think that's a good thing. Overall, I am happy with the helmet and would recommend it to someone looking for a good price / value / features helmet that wants something fairly aggressive in design / looks and doesn't want to jump up to the $600 - $800 range for a helmet.\n",

      "I bought this helmet for my husband for the new riding season. It's the most expensive helmet he's ever owned.First thought: he loved the look. He recently blacked out his custom cruiser and all other helmets just seemed to look too sporty.Fit: Head-wise, it fit nicely. The measurements were very accurate, however, the cheek pads were where the helmet fit snug. Thankfully, this helmet has interchangeable cheek pads and we swapped out for a thinner size. Now it fits great!Ride: Unfortunately, he hasn't taken it for a ride yet. It's still pretty cold here in Maine but he can't wait for the snow to disappear!We found three cons with this helmet so far.1. This first con comes from me: I wish this shield was pinlock ready to prevent fogging. (My husband has no idea what this means because this is his first \"Luxury\" helmet. I own a Shoei RF-1200 so I know what he's missing out on;)2. This second con is also from me: I wish this shield was quick change so you could swap out your dark and clear shield without tools. (Again, my husband doesn't care about this. He wears sunglasses on the way to work and takes them off at night when he heads home. I would just like the blacked out look when we're riding around during the day.)3. This third and last known con comes from my husband: I'm not even kidding. This is not a joke people. His con is the COLOR! That's right. You read that correctly! The color! This helmet comes in only two solid shades: a white and matte black. I got my husband the matte black but he swears up and down that this is NOT MATTE! He calls it charcoal or gunmetal because this finish has a very faint sparkle to it and couldn't possibly be called matte, let alone black. I'm required to take off a star for this purpose though I don't think it's the biggest deal of the century.It's still a very nice looking helmet, especially if you don't want that sporty look but still want a full face helmet. I'm so glad I found it and my husband will too once he starts riding with it!\n",

But it was colder than my other helmet even with everything closed off so I'm assuming if it were open it'd be pretty cold.Only thing I didn't like is that it kind of stings when you first put it on. I am bald though so maybe having hair cushions that.Oh. It's pretty expensive too. That sucks. I got it on black friday for 100 less.\n",

Noise is dulled yet not completely silent like noise cancelling headphones. I wish the visor could be taken out in one fluid step so I can switch to the smoked visor ( I recommend), but it's fine the way it is. Wide view. The platform is dual-sport so there is not as much neck protection as I would've liked. Came in a nice helmet bag and with stickers. Woohoo\n",

      "Certainly this helmet has almost everything: feather weight, right size, wide vision, great protection and real good performance... BUT air flow is not it's best characteristic and has a very bad flaw: the small rubber flap on top of the visor is to close to it, so every time you open and close it this rubber thing rubs the visor until the point it gets scratched from the inside.Some friends that decided to invest in this helmet also have the same problem, and is not worth it to get a new visor because it's gonna get scratched too.We had to make a petition to AGV in Italy in order to get a warranty fix, but that was more than a month ago and no response has been given.\n",

I wear earplugs most of the time so it's not that big of a deal. The shield change mechanism is pretty annoying with the screws and the washers. The straps with the D-rings dig into my jaw if it's positioned a certain way. However my biggest gripe is that when it rains water trickles from the top down the inside of the face shield. Perhaps I was just spoiled with my shoei's rubber gasket, but in a heavy downpour it makes it hard to see.\n",

The shield changing mechanism is a bit of a hassle but since I don't really change my shields it doesn't really apply to me. My biggest gripe to be honest is the fact that there is a really prominent whistle on head checks and if your head is not in the right position. Also my chin curtain broke off within a week which kind of sucks but not really a deal breaker. This helmet just looks so cool that it kind of outweighs any of the negatives that the helmet might have. In terms of fit I'm still a bit confused. I bought a large as that is what I've measured with AGV but I feel like maybe I should have gotten a medium since a large at first was really snug, maybe too snug. But after 2 weeks of weekend riding i don't feel as snug as I would like. I can't answer about safety since I haven't tested that and am not planning to.\n",

      "I just wanna start off by saying, the customer service at Revzilla is, bar none, the best in the business. I spoke with a customer representative on the phone, and it was like talking to a buddy. I was on the fence about which helmet to buy, and he took the time to talk to me and help me figure out what was the best helmet for me. Which leads me to my review of this helmet because I love it!We all know this helmet looks very cool. In person it lives up to the bad a** look it gives off in the pictures. I've been taking the face shield off and wearing goggles with it, and it's just awesome!As advertised, the helmet is very lightweight, which makes it very comfortable to ride in. I commute to work on the freeway, so I'm traveling at speeds of 75-80 mph for extended periods of time, and I experience very little head fatigue. I ride a harley sportster, and I find the helmet to be much better suited for an upright position than something like the Bell Star.A lot of the reviews mentioned the helmet was noisy, but my experience is just the opposite. When riding with the face shield on, I find it to be quieter than my other two full face helmets, HJC and BELL. I also have the gringo, but that's obviously very loud. I haven't experienced the whistling noise others have claimed to experience.It's a great helmet for those who want the protection of a full face helmet, but still want that bare bones gnarly look of a Harley.There are only two things I can say this helmet can improve on. First, the face shield: it does't open and close smoothly, and there's no quick release to take it on and off. Second, the chin curtain fell apart the first few days I had the helmet.\n",

      "This helmet has good air flow, and is rather comfortable so do recommend it. However it is almost comically long front to back so the profile I look like the great gazzoo. From the front head on I look like an assassin.The field of view is better then any helmet I have ever had, and I have had the best of Shoei, and Arai. You literally have an unobstructed view to the side. Zero interference from helmet.Pro's:Very lightGreat field of visionGood air flowVer comfortableUniqueCon's:Rather loudThe front to back length is just too long for my tasteIf you get this helmet, you have to get the dark smoked visor to finish the look.\n",

      "-Fitment is a pretty snug for me, as I ordered a size small. I could have ordered a medium, but after my previous experience with an AGV Grid I decided to go for the snug fit. The Grid was a great fit when I first purchased, but became less snug over time as the padding became more broken in. I anticipate that the AX-8 EVO will be a perfect fit once broken in.-Noise level is definitely lower than that of the Grid. I did notice a very slight whistle on the right, which became more pronounced during a shoulder check. Overall, the helmet is still very quiet.-This thing is super-duper light. I've noticed that I get much less fatigued around the neck area compared to when I am wearing the Grid. I'm 5' 11\", and ride an SV650S in the stock riding position, save for a Sargent seat, so I would contribute this to a slight weight difference as well as a difference in aerodynamics. The airflow is quite good as well. I've seen some complaints about a bit of turbulence around 60-70mph and higher, but I have hardly noticed it myself. I think windscreen design and riding position have much more to do with this than helmet design. While I have noticed a little turbulence, it has been very insignificant for me.-The field of vision. Woah. I didn't know my face could get that warm while riding in the sun... Or that the sky was quite so blue. Might have to invest in some sunblock for my face, because the field of vision is just that wide. Also, it is worth noting that the visor seals very tightly. Nothing is getting through, around, or under the visor when it is closed.Overall, I would strongly recommend this helmet to anyone else out there riding a poor man's Ducati. I've found it to be exceptionally good for commuting as well as sport touring. It looks gnarly, too.I would warn anyone reading this, particularly if they own an SV, that this thing may cause you to do a bit of dual sport-esque riding on their street bike. Weeeee!\n",

      "500 mile review on both Street and Dual Sport riding with 13 KLR 650 and 14 Ninja 1000:Pros:Looks great, feels great, wide field of view to the point if you didn't feel the cheek pads on your face you wouldn't know its on! I went to scratch my nose once and hit my closed visor with my hand! Some complained of obstructed view with visor full open. I only got this when I had the helmet too far down in front. Where it has settled, the lower edge of visor is out of the way unless your looking high above.Head checks are easy and helmet is light, light, light!With a dark smoke visor the thing looks sick as a stealth fighter pilot helmet or a dark lord of the Sith. I got lots of compliments even at a Harley ride!Cons:Chin strap should have been quick release for the money they ask for the helmet.It is not the quietest helmet for sure, whistles a bit on head checks.Air flow is adequate, not superior.Chin vent is a piece of garbage. Destroyed with only a few on and offs.Neutral Info:Runs a bit big. So if your contemplating between sizes, like I did with a 23\" head, go a down size. Revzilla recommended this to me and I was right on with a Med.Nose/breath guard does its job when in place. It warms the helmet significantly. This is a pro in cold, a con if hot. Install accordingly.Get the dark smoke visor along with purchase. If anything, for street daytime riding!\n",

      "I've been riding with this helmet for about three months and I absolutely love it. It feels infinitely lighter than my Bell RS-1 and has never felt fatiguing to wear, even after 3+ hour rides. The visibility is exceptional, and the large field of view mixed with the light weight make head checks very easy and comfortable. The buffeting at speed is present but not unbearable. Again, the light weight makes it easy for me to keep my head from doing 180s on the expressway.It is loud at speed, but I use noise cancelling in-ear headphones which clears that right up, no problem.I bought the smoked visor for this helmet and get tons of compliments on the overall appearance. I've uploaded a picture since there's a baffling lack of them online.It's worth mentioning that the alternate mesh mouthpiece he mentions in the video is difficult to find. I'm told by a local Dainese store that they are actually out of production indefinitely, which took them days of investigating to figure out. I haven't spoken to a single sales rep or owner of this helmet who even knew the piece existed before I asked about it, including the Revzilla rep I talked to.Overall I'm stoked about the purchase and would buy another one if I ever needed to.**I ride an '04 ZX6R (spiritedly on the street).\n",

Though, there is a vent at the mouth which works amazingly. I have never once had problems with my visor flogging up, even at a stand still. It also offers very wide peripheral vision especially suited for every day commuters who have to do frequent shoulder checks. My only qualm with this product is the way it's designed aerodynamically. When traveling at 75 mph, doing shoulder checks can be a bit of a job. The noise level is not so healthy either, but is expected when traveling down any busy free-way. If you do decided to commit to this helmet, I would recommend getting the 'smoke screen' visor with it. The appearance is Intense!\n",

The venting on the sport helmets favor a more bent over position, while this one is better when you are upright. The problem is the helmet has a BAD whistle at speed. At 80 mph (not that I ride that fast) it screams like a banshee. Don't get me wrong, I like AGV helmets, but this is working out to be an expensive mistake for me.\n",

As a plain street helmet, the AX-8 has a low weight, good ventilation, and great visibility, and I love the way it looks.I rated it \"Good\" for value because it is a fairly premium helmet at a price point that comes in under Shoei and Arai, but I still feel like it's slightly on the spendy side for what you get. I rated it 5 out of 5 stars, but if you don't wear earplugs, it's a louder helmet than average.\n",

This is not a helmet for long rides at 70+ mph, especially if, like me, you usually wear a full-face helmet. The wind noise is as you would expect. Also, as the helmet is more rounded than full-face helmets, the fit is a little tighter. But it gets better with each ride, as the face cushions adapt to your head shape.\n",

The design is as good as it can get when you consider the movie helmets were of a different shape. The helmet looks like it's been well used, and overall it looks great.The visor is easy to work and doesn't shake or rattle. The helmet is light to wear and doesn't seem to jerk your head around. Being an open face, airflow is good overall, though it could use a little more over the top of the head. My only complaint about this helmet, and the reason it's getting 4 instead of 5 starts, is that it gets a little uncomfortable after about 40 minutes of wear. There is a seam between the padding of the forehead and the top liner that presses against my head. At first it's not noticeable, but after some time really starts to irritate.

I've waited a few weeks to write this as I wanted to give it a fair opinion, I also own a Bell 500 for comparison.-It's slightly heavier than the Bell but that is hardly noticeable. -The fit around the cheek pads is a bit more snug than the Bell which means it is also quieter, but warmer. -The Bell does have a lower profile, doesn't sit as tall on the head. -The visor is a cool little feature, I don't use it often but the first day riding home from work I got caught in a quick rain shower.  Flipped it down, worked perfectly, flipped it up and my sunglasses were still dry.

I think HJC did a great job on this helmet. Drop Down Visor - Visor is great. No warping of view. No rattle in the wind. Easy to move up and down.Lighter than other helmets I've had.Cons:Wind runs across your eyes when you turn your head.Fits slightly small. I was inbetween the M and the L based on the size chart. I went with the L and I'm very glad I did. it fits perfect.No tab on the double d-ring makes it hard to take off with gloves on. No vents. Not a huge deal since it's a 3/4, but still can get warm up top. Loud - Again, minor con as I expect a 3/4 to be pretty loud. Overall, I have no regrets. I would buy again.

      "I love  this helmet, wish I had gotten it years ago. It is quiet , fits well, and feels good. I feel safer in it and am safer .  The drop down visor is great, I can use it on all but the brightest days and not have to use sunglasses.  Very handy to be able to flip drop down visor up when entering a tunnel  or shaded areas where it is hard otherwise to see gravel  in the roadway.  If you think this may be the helmet for you,  then don't wait order one today.\n",

      "This is my first Shoei helmet.  Since my purchase, I've learned that this is an older helmet designed for smaller speakers.  In order to make my Harley corded headset speakers fit, I did what some others have done.  I used a sharp knife and cut around the periphery of the pockets so as to accommodate my speakers. Speakers are held firmly in place with velcro.  The modification worked great, but I just voided my warranty.  I essentially guessed about protection and durability as this is a new helmet.  The helmet fit very snug at first, but now is perfect. Three stars is due to speaker issue\n",

      "I started riding 20 yrs ago with a M shoei full face. It was perfect.  As I replaced helmets over time, I went to cheaper ones.  None felt or fit  as good as the first one.  Finally went back to shoei and picked up this 3/4 helmet...the sizing guide still had me at M.  It was too tight and drilled into my temples.   Swapped it with a L, and it fit perfectly.  My head is asking why I waited so long to return to shoei.  If following the shoei sizing guide, be prepared to possibly move up a size.   Revzilla shipping, exchange and customer service was top notch.\n",

      "I bought the J Cruise from Revzilla because I have used them before excellent service.  I received the helmet 4 days after ordering and spent about 2 hours wearing it around the house to make sure of the fit which turned out good. I will write another review after I get some miles on it. This is the first pricey helmet I've ever bought and I've been riding about 55 years I ride an Indian Chieftain and normally wear  either a modular in the winter and a half helmet in the summer which I normally buy cheap at rallies. I will say it is very comfortable and the fit is very good these are a lot different than the 3/4 helmets I wore back in the day. It will be interesting to see how it works in the real world. I will write a better review in a month or two after I put some miles on it, now that the weather is changing I will only ride 2 or 300 miles a week.\n",

      "I bought this helmet and then wore it on a trip of 1,000 miles.At first it seemed too tight on my face, but it loosed up  fairly quickly. It is a well-built helmet with actual venting. I haven't experienced any venting before from a 3/4 helmet. The face shield is nice, it locks closed positively, and sheds rain quite well. I rode in heavy rain for several hours and no water made it under the shield. Unfortunately, after about 2 hours of rain, water worked in through the front top vent and the liner got soaked.The other thing that I noticed is that the helmet is absolutely stifling when standing still. When you're moving the vents make you comfortable, but you better take it off immediately if you get off to gas up and it's warm outside.Overall, it's a pretty nice helmet for fair weather. I don't think I'd pay $530 for it again. This is the first \"premium\" helmet I have purchased. I have worn a Scorpion 3/4 helmet previously. It had different flaws which is why I replaced it. The Scorpion can be had for about $200 bucks, I think. I can forgive a cheap helmet for having flaws. I don't feel the same type of charity with this one considering what I paid.One last thing, I ride a HD with, what most would consider, a quiet exhaust. The sound of the mufflers reverberate in this helmet until it is maddening after a while.\n",

No buffeting with the shield downNow the \"but\".I cannot wear any \"in ear canal\" earplugs with this helmet without getting a sharp pain in my ears. I have tried the thinner cheek pads but they do not have an impact on the ear pocket.My head is in the open when I ride and there is a roar at speeds over 40, hence the need for earplugs. Might be different behind a fairing.Overall, I am happy with the helmet and the Revzilla staff that answered questions and helped me with my purchase.\n",

J-cruise is a size 2X, still very, very tight and difficult to put on, cheek pad area very narrow, have to pull helmet apart to put on, then adjust ears to fit correctly. Once on, it fits very snug, but so far (3 months), reasonably comfortable all around, no pressure points. Shield & pinlock are great.  Vents are average, no better, no worse than others, sun visor works good and allows use of glasses/sun glasses. Shoei needs a size 3x, their shell seems small compared to others of same size.\n",

      "I ride a lot of hwy miles at 70 mph - ahem, or a little more :)  And my last helmet used to buffet in the wind a little bit.  I had a Shoei RF 800 many years ago that was super quiet and well behaved in the wind.  So I decided to try the J-Cruise.  I wasn't disappointed.  This helmet makes my hwy riding MUCH more comfortable.  It is stable in the wind and the vision (field of view) is excellent.  The built-in sun shield is great too - I don't carry sun glasses any more and the clear screen is excellent at night.  Ventilation is also top notch.  I added the Sena 10U.  My only paranoia is that it might get stolen.  So, I usually carry it with me instead of leaving it w my bike.  Otherwise - it is excellent.  Pricey - but excellent.The size chart listed me right on the cusp between M/L - which I thought was crazy 'cause I have a big head.  I ordered the L.  Sure enough - I needed an XL.  Revzilla made the exchange lightning fast.  Revzilla is awesome.\n",

      "I ordered this helmet to replace an old very tired one that no longer fit correctly.   I wanted to have protection for a planned 2500 mile ride from Texas to the Carolina.  This one fit the bill.This is a really nice helmet.   The fit is spot on and the air flow is a pleasant surprise.  I really wanted to give this 5 star rating but one thing kept me from giving it that score.  I wear trifocal glasses and to see distances, I look thru the top section of my glasses.   The slot between the top of the cheek pad and the top liner allowing for eyeglass temples is too high which lifts my eyeglasses up slightly on the bridge of my nose.  The forces me to tilt my head slightly forward to allow me to see down the road.  After several hours of riding, this tends to be a problem.   I'm exploring several options to open up this gap slightly to allow the temples to sit correctly.   I guess my ears are too low. Aside from the eyeglass concern, I'm very pleased with the performance.  The fit is firm but comfortable.  The liner worked well to absorb the perspiration on my head and keeping me much cooler than my prev helmet and no hot spots. The drop down interior visor comes in very handy during the bright sunshine and the main visor is excellent in keeping rain out, especially during downpours. The helmet is very quiet and become slightly less quiet when the vents are open.    I would definitely recommend this helmet to those looking for a 3/4 style helmet.\n",

I have no regrets, and where it all the time. I especially like the function of the flip down sun visor and that I don't have to take multiple pairs of goggles with me.

      "Terrific Open Face Helmet\n",
      "I purchased the J-Cruise as a replacement/upgrade for my aging HJC IS-33. The HJC is a good lid, but the J-Cruise is far superior: lighter, much stiffer shell, better ventilation, considerably quieter, more stable at speed, nicer materials inside, terrific overall fit and finish. Of course, you would expect this based on the cost - I must say I have not been disappointed. IMHO, the J-Cruise is worth the extra money. You only get issued one noggin in life - best protect it!The J-Cruise serves as my Houston summer alternative to my Neotec. In many respects, the helmets are quite similar. The insides are nearly identical; the J-Cruise sports a double-lipped visor seal in contrast to the Neotec's single-lipped seal.  All in all, Neotec wearers will find in the J-Cruise a familiar fit and user experience, and the added ventilation of a 3/4 helmet.\n",

The internal visor hit my nose.  I'd read that people were shaving down the visor to not hit their nose and that didn't sound right to me.Tried the J-Cruise on and WOW, what a difference. It feels snug, in a good way, and everything works as smooth as butter. Super lightweight but quality. Great air flow, clear vision, both through the shield and the sun visor.Very glad i chose this over the HJC.If you have the means, i highly recommend it!\n",

      "Another winner from Shoei\n",
      "After riding with the Shoei Multitech for about 5 years, I decided that it was time for a new helmet. I usually ride with a half-helmet in the summer, and a modular in the winter/inclement weather. So, this year I decided to split the difference and get a 3/4 helmet, as I also want to (eventually) incorporate Bluetooth audio into the helmet. After two days, I can tell you that this helmet is top-notch. It feels much lighter than the Multitech, probably due to the lack of a movable front piece. With the faceshield down, the optical clarity is amazing, and you do not get the slightly claustrophobic feeling that often accompanies a full face helmet, and you do not even notice the Pinlock insert (if you have one installed).  The airflow is phenomenal. Riding home from work last night in about 40 degree weather, the only cold air that I noticed was around my eyes (which was about the same as riding with the faceshield cracked open in my Multitech), and around my chin and mouth. The air flow across my lower face was easily fixed with a neck gaiter or balaclava. Keeping the rear vents open eliminated much of the swirling air around my eyes, but I still noticed the cold air coming in. I noticed very little fogging, and had to exhale fairly hard to induce any fogging at all on the visor where my mouth is. As such, a Pinlock* insert may not even be necessary unless you plan to ride in temperatures colder than 40 degrees. (I will update as the winter progresses) The retractable sun visor worked flawlessly (as to be expected in a helmet in the sub-$500 range), and actually provided more shade than my usual pair of sunglasses/riding goggles due to the width of the shade. I current ride a Honda Shadow Aero 750, with a Memphis Shades windshield positioned at roughly nose height. I experienced virtually no wind buffeting at speeds around 45 mph. The helmet is fairly quiet. All I could really hear was my pipes, and the usual \"rushing wind\" noise that I get with my 1/2 helmet was absent. In short, if you are in the market for a 3/4 helmet, and are not tied to the Nolan or Schuberth com systems, then the Shoei is a good choice!*If you have never used a Pinlock visor, and have issues with fogging, I highly recommend a Pinlock insert. I ride with one day and night in my Multitech, and now my J-Cruise, and I have noticed no issues that would negatively affect night riding.\n",

      "This is my second Shoei helmet (both purchased from Revzilla) which should address the quality and value of the product. I have owned for 5 years now a full-face Shoei and have appreciated the exemplary implementation of the form. One issue with the older full-face Shoei is that it is more sport oriented (expected) and now that I ride another really great product (Indian Scout) the sporting nature of the helmet has some issues with buffeting as I hold my head more upright. I also was looking for a more summer season helmet in the J-Cruise. With the J-Cruise I don't have the buffeting issues; the vents move a lot of air (along with being open-face); visibility is great; it is quiet and pretty light weight compared to my older full-face Shoei. I couldn't be happier and consider this a great value. And as I end all of my reviews, Revzilla had it to my door (free) within three days. I highly recommend both the J-Cruise and Revzilla.My only \"complaint: it would be nice for Shoei to offer the helmet in MORE COLORS and maybe some GRAPHICS. (How many shades of grey - (50?) or black does one need?) It would also be helpful to have a sunshade with a gradational tint from welder's-goggle dark up high to a lighter gray near the bottom edge.

So I ordered them. Again shipment was prompt. The pads felt better. I was leaving on a trip the next day. So I installed my HD headset. The speakers are too big to fit in the helmet recession so the velcro does not connect. And the design does not make it easy if you wear glasses. Halfway through the first day of my trip the check pads pressed on the lower half of my ears making it uncomfortable. Not sure if a XXL size would be comfortable. But the XL is not. Since I wore the helmet I cannot exchange it. So I now have a $450 shelf warmer.\n",

      "Finally found a helmet I actually look forward to wearing. I have tried several but rarely end up wearing any of them for a variety of reasons; however, the J-Cruise may change all that. It fit true to size. I wear a 7 1/4 New Era fitted hat and my bean measured 22 7/8; right at the top end of the Medium. So I ordered the medium. Helmet fit great right out of the box. I love the optical clarity, wide field of vision & functionality of both shields. The strap is very comfortable. There were no pressure points to worry about. Fit is snug but not uncomfortable. I really almost forgot I had it on most of the time. The fit and finish is what you would expect from a high end brain bucket. I chose the matte black and I'm very happy with that choice. I took it right out of the box and went for a 2.5 hour spin out of town. Felt like I had been wearing it for years. Same experience on the 2.5 hours back the next day. I was most impressed with the aerodynamics of the J-Cruise. There is absolutely no wind buffeting with this helmet. It really is like no other helmet I have ever worn. Highly recommend this product.

      "I had reservations about paying this much for a helmet but I am glad I did! A great helmet. I have a LS2 that I liked but it was getting flimsy after using it for 12000 miles. I have had a Nolan also. Both the LS2 and Nolan were size small so I ordered a small in the J Cruise. It was so tight on the side of my head that is caused pain and I had to return it and ordered a medium. No problem with Revzilla! When I got the medium it was a little big so I ordered a 13mm center pad (came with a 9mm) and now it fits great. My head shape is kind of flat on the back so the oval shape in the small was just a no go. This helmet is worth every penny. The fit and finish are top notch and the comfort level is outstanding. the air flow is the best of any helmet I have worn. Comparing this J Cruise with a LS2 is like comparing night and day. that much difference.\n",

The sun visor works smooth and flawlessly and is a huge convenience since I hate wearing sunglasses in my helmet. My head measured 22.5\" so I ordered the medium and it fits great. If you are on the fence about going to a 3/4 helmet, go for the J-Cruise, you won't regret it.\n",

      "I have been looking for this helmet for sometime now. The two largest motorsport stores only had one on display . Yes it fit just wrong color. Not real impressed with there staff anyways. So Revzilla reviews won me over. Ordering process was fast along with the delivery. Only 3 days. I had one call from your CSR about the order on a Monday and it was at the post office on Thursday. Your rep who I talked to made a typo and sent out a cancellation notice. HE immediately call me right back and said he was sorry about the email.. and not to worry my lid will be there in a few day. I don't remember his name but he was top notch. Spent about 3 hrs with the new helmet in 102 temps. Its a typical Shoei. quiet, good ventilation, lite and well made. Oh, and the extra discount you gave me. Could not beat that at the big stores. Anthony you have a great crew. I will be back. Thank you. And I ride a 13 R1200GSA.\n",

      "Apprehensive at first, but very glad that I bought it\n",
      "The only reason why I was apprehensive was because of the cost. Buying a 3/4 helmet for almost $500 is a pretty big commitment, but Revzilla has an excellent return and exchange program that made me feel comfortable with giving it a shot. And I'm glad that I did.The helmet is true to size, and the sizing chart is accurate. I have an intermediate oval head, and this fit me very well. I was actually impressed with the cheek pads and liner. They both feel like they are built to last a very long time.This is my first Shoei helmet. So, I'm not aware of how well their other helmets'venting systems are, but the ventilation in this thing is amazing. I wore it on a good 90+ degree day, and my head was very comfortable the whole time. I could actually feel the air moving around my head, and I've never been able to say that before.I love the face shield and sun visor. When the visor is down, the lines are very clean between it and the helmet. I guess you could say that the fit and finish on this helmet reflect the price that is paid for it.And one of the most important things to me is how quiet the helmet is, which goes hand in hand with wind buffeting. This thing is noticeably quieter than a full face that I ride with in Winter. I actually notice how loud my bike is because I don't have wind noise drowning it out. My head is steady at highway speeds. And did I say that this helmet us quiet?I don't have any cons. If I were to be extremely picky, it would have been nice to have a magnetic strap instead of the standard button. The button is nice though.So, bottom line, this is an excellent helmet for anyone looking for a quality 3/4 helmet.\n",

      "Comfortable, Quiet Touring Lid\n",
      "I would have given this helmet 5 stars if it wasn't so pricey. This is my first helmet over $200, but I decided to take the leap and see if the Shoei name lived up to its price and hype. I've had 2 3/4 helmets and several full-featured helmets in the past and this is by far the most comfortable helmet I've ever owned (as it should be - I paid more than twice what I've ever paid for a previous helmet).I've always worn an XL, so that's what I ordered for this helmet. Comparing it to my last 3/4, the shell seems slightly larger comparing them side by side. This may be partially due to the added \"bump\" on the front of the shell where the sun-visor retracts. When I put it on, it feels roomier inside, but still snug and secure. I don't feel any pressure points at all and can ride for hours without any hot spots. It just cradles my head securely without squeezing it. The cheek pads are the tightest part, but after a couple long rides I can tell already that they've broken in a little and fit better.The ear pockets are great with plenty of room for my J&M speakers and nothing at all pressing against my ears. I can also hear my speakers so much better and clearer in this helmet than in the previous 2 I've had them mounted in.The air flow in this helmet is incredible. I have a shaved head and can feel the air hitting my forehead and flowing all the way over my head to the back of my neck. With my previous helmets the airflow was so light that I almost never closed the vents. In this helmet I have to close the front chimney vent when it's cool out. The interior liner material is incredibly soft and comfortable, and does a great job of keeping me comfy on hot rides.The visor system is great, easy to operate and solid feeling. I can definitely tell a difference between my last 3/4 visor and this one with the little spoiler lip on the bottom. The spoiler helps smooth air flow at the bottom of the visor and chin area, and I've noticed it helps keep bugs and rain from being sucked up into the face area.All in all, this is a fantastic touring helmet. I feel safe with it on my dome, and can enjoy my tunes and CB radio so much more than ever before. The price is pretty high, but if you tour a lot and have the cash I highly recommend the Shoei J-Cruise.\n",

      "Excellent Cruiser Helmet\n",
      "I received my Shoei J-Cruise helmet yesterday from Revzilla (excellent service and fast shipping by the way) and wanted to give a small update (or so I thought before I started). A little of my back ground first. When I initially began riding (a very long time ago) I only used full face helmets. Gradually throughout the years, I ended up just wearing a skid lid, non DOT half helmet with good eye protection. I enjoyed the openness and wind on my face. I mostly rode on the week-ends because my job in the military just didn’t allow for motorcycles and wearing a non DOT was very much frowned upon and against policy.Since retiring, I ride almost every day now with my daily commute being 100+ miles. I’m used to riding in the rain; the summer months in Florida with the heat and humidity make rain gear pointless. I get to my destination in the morning when it’s usually dry, and arrive home wet to change clothes. No big deal. Except for the fact that riding in the rain on the interstate and turnpike where speeds are 70+ mph kind of blows. I’ve also aged a little bit and admittedly abused my exposure to the sun over the years.Well, I wanted protection again but I haven’t been able to find anything that provided that level of comfort. While riding through TN I got tired of being worried about getting pulled over with my non DOT so I bought a HD half helmet with shield on sale. It was alright but the shield didn’t provide much protection from the sun and gave little protection from the rain. The rain would drip down the shield and blow up in my face. Later I bought a modular HJC helmet with a one touch integrated tinted sun shield, this helmet was a disaster and the worst $200 I ever spent. Feeling like my search was for nothing, I went back to my skid lid.After a couple of bouts of skin cancer I read the reviews of the Shoei J-Cruise and took the plunge ($477 at Revzilla). I’m glad I did.Pros: It has a full face shield that protects you from 99% of the sun’s UV rays. The shield locks firmly in place when closed and nothing rattles going down the road at 80 mph. The face shield moves up and down amazingly smooth. It locks in place when fully closed but I have no problems unlocking it and moving it up. I was amazed how cool I was riding home this afternoon in the 97 degree Florida sun, the ventilation works great with no noise at all. Usually when I arrive home wearing my skid lid, I’m sweating under the helmet. Very little sweat with the J-Cruise. I love the drop down sun visor too. It’s cable driven to sliding lever, no springs or anything. The sun visor stays well clear of my nose and provides great relief. Wind buffeting?? None. Absolutely no wind buffeting. I’m able to ride with the face shield open up to 45 mph where I begin to feel buffeting but it all goes away when you close the face shield. Funny thing is, I’m actually cooler to close the face shield at 35 mph so it pretty much just stayed closed. I have as much visibility as when I wear my skid lid. I don’t hear any wind noise or road noise to mention.Cons: I can’t leave my helmet on top of my mirror any more. Guess I have to start securing it in my Tour Pak. I do hear the engine resonating in my helmet but not to the point it’s bothersome. I don’t hear the surrounding traffic any more until I’m right up on them. That includes tractor trailers on the interstate, so you have to pay more attention to what’s coming up behind you. I’m worried about scratching my face shield and sun shield (but at least they’re exchangeable).Love the helmet and zero regrets. In case you need a comparison, I ride a 2015 Ultra Limited, V&H Dresser Duals with Monster Ovals, 7” windshield, hammock seat, I’m 6’ tall with a standard upper body length.\n",

This helmet fits snuggly, comfortably, and I feel much safer with my melon tucked away inside.\n",

I was hospitalized for three months with major body injuries but I had no head injuries other than a few stitches in my chin thanks to this helmet. I still have the helmet to remind me how lucky I was on that day. After 10 months I back riding. Thanks again Shoei for helping to save my life.\n",

      "This is my second Shoei J-Cruise. Got 7 years out of the last one (probably should have changed a little sooner). The newer model fits even better (snugger, lighter) than the first. I really like open face design because of the superior vision and ability to flip the visor and get more air when I need it (i.e. stopped, slow). They added the flip down internal sun visor to this model which I think changed the fit configuration a little. Even though it was the same size as my last J-Cruise (large) I had real pressure on my forehead (i.e. caused headaches!) when I first wore it and eventually had to open it up and sand down a bit of the foam in that area - which solved the problem. And it still causes some pressure pain on my ears after awhile - but that disappears when I remove it for a bit. However - in all a great helmet - as you would expect from a top of the line (expensive) Shoei. Haven't found anything else that fits my head better.\n",

      "My head measured at the high end of Large. I ordered a XL and the sides of my face still felt tight. It might be due to the fact that I have worn a 1/2 helmet for 25 years without any shield. Now that I'm getting older, I wanted a bit more protection from the rain and wind during longer rides. Fortunately I was able to order thinner Shoei side pads from Revzilla. 31mm vs the 35's that came standard. That did the trick. Cost was not bad, used my helmet rewards cash toward the purchase. Now I have a comfortable helmet.I was worried about the weight. the J-Cruise feels light, no problems with weight. Visibility is one of the J-Cruise helmets biggest assets, I am amazed at how well I can see behind that shield, no distortion. The tinted drop down shield works perfect, again, no distortion.The vents in the J-Cruise work better than expected, I have never had a helmet vent this well. Really nice on a warm day.This is a real expensive helmet. The only reasons I marked the rating down at all was due to the value. Shoei is very proud of this helmet, and the tight fit, wish I could have ordered the helmet with the thinner side pads day one. This of course could be more of a owner ( me ) problem than Shoei.Revzilla has been great, I will order from them again in the future. Top notch company.

      "I should have worn it around the house for at least a little over an hour, so I could have realized there were pressure points that after an hour were only going to grow in intensity until all I can think about is how I can't wait to take off my helmet.It's an intermediate oval M, but so is my full face Arai RX Q. But the Arai never hurts. It's a very comfortable fit, for the short or long ride. So going by the designations of oval, round, or intermediate isn't enough.I can only wear my J-Cruise for short rides around town running errands. But for the long outings where we'll be riding for more than an hour, forgetaboutit. I experience a throbbing pressure on the top sides of my head, as if I had a pair of pliers gripping my head at a point on each side. I try to ignore it, but the pain grows more and more intense until I have to giggle the helmet as much as I can, just to get a moment's relief from the pressure points.I love the shield. It's clear and has excellent visibility. I wear it almost all the way down, and can vary the drop, depending on the speed I'm riding at, and the weather. When I'm stop and go, and it's warm, i pull it up at the stops, and wear it 3/4s down. When I'm on the freeway, I pull it down further. I rarely lock it down, because I have to raise it often, to adjust my glasses, but that's a different matter.I love the ventilation. I love the retractable visor.. It's perfect for when you don't want to wear your sunglasses non stop.Nearing sunset, it depends on the direction your riding, you might find yourself in shadows of hills or ranges, or you may be heading straight into the sun where you must wear shades. It's very cool then.It's noisiest when the shield is all the way down, and gets less noisy accordingly. I wear protective earplugs when I ride highways or freeways, to avoid the damage of long term wind noise--\"the silent killer (of your hearing).I bought mine in a matte black, which I like, but it does smudge easily and is not as easy to clean up like a gloss finished helmet.I wish it didn't hurt my head! I love this helmet for so many reasons, but I am going to try to sell it. I wish Arai still made their Arai XC in the Ram model, with the removable lingers. That would be my replacement helmet. I love the way my Arai RX Q fits, and know Arai fits me great.I'm going to sell my J-Cruise for as much as I can get, and shop for its replacement.I ride a 2011 HD Sportster 1200 Custom.\n",

      "The helmet arrived really fast, it has a early 2014 date code. The fit was tight at first but after wearing around house for a bit it feels just fine. My head measured a loose 23\" and 22 7/8 tight. Which actually put me at the top end of a Meduim. I ordered a large and am happy with th fit.I will use it on my Gl1800 so was concerned with a headset install. I installed a new universal HS-EHI-787-UNV-XHO clamp on headset from J&M which fit without any modification of the helmet. I did remove the back layer of velcro material from the speakers so they would sit in the recess of the speaker area of the helmet and then put velcro material around the perimiter of the speakers for the top speaker covering material to adhere to. Larger speakers would fit if you are willing to remove helmet material, I chose not to do this.Pricing on this helmet from Revzilla seems to be about the same as other retailers, The free size exchange takes the worry out of the purchase. Using the helmet I think it is fairly quiet for a 3/4 with the vents closed and the face shield and sun visor are of good optic quality. Venting seems good. Weight is not an issue. The interior material is of excelllent quality. All things comsidered I am pleased with my purchase and would consider another Shoei product when that time comes.Now lets Ride!!\n",

      "After 40 years of hanging onto a set of handlebars, I thought I would splurge once and get away from those 75 dollar helmets I've worn over the past years. After the sticker shock wore off, I got a decent weekend to ride last weekend and try out my new shoei. The quality of the fit and finish exceeds anything I ever wore, and the ventilation actually works. That is new to me because my other helmets with vents do not seem to circulate any air like the j cruise does. I am really impressed with the optics on both the shield and the shades. The helmet shield is also ready for a pin lock lens. The finish is very deep and glossy, not like the pictures would indicate. I got mine in gloss black and it really shines. The main reason for the purchase was to install the upgraded interphone headset. I am hearing impaired and had difficulty hearing with those stock speakers, but I hear comfortably now at half volume. My Softail has Vance and Hines long shots and is loud, but this helmet cuts down on the sound very noticeably. And the speaker kit fits the inside of the j cruise seamlessly.\n",

Pulling the helmet on rips my behind the ear hearing aids off of my ears and also pulls my glasses off. The same issue when pulling the helmet off with the glasses on.I can't put the hearing aids back in because the cheek pads fit to tight to get my fingers inside the helmet. It's difficult but I can put the glasses back on again but the cheek pads are very snug and squeeze the glasses arms and makes them uncomfortable against my temples.Taking the cheek pads out solves those issues but then the helmet doesn't fit as well and is slightly loose.FYI, I ordered an extra set of the smallest size cheek pads.Good thing my hearing and vision are not debilitating because I can ride without either. But I don't like to.It would be helpful if Shoei made cheek pads that would be just cheek pads and not also fit up the side of the ears or adjustable so that you can remove small sections so they can adjust to the rider.I like the helmet but it won't be my all the time every day helmet, more of a winter or rainy day one or where I don't have to hear or see as well.\n",

      "This helmet is one of the more higher priced open face helmets but the quality far exceeds most all other helmets in this category. The air vents are large and easy to use with gloves as is the lever to deploy and retract the integrated sun shield. I have always worn extra large in shoei helmets and they have all been slightly loose according to the videos that I have watched. According to the Shoei size chart I should be in a size large so that is what I ordered. Just as another reviewer stated, there was unbearable pressure points at my frontal and high temple area which I am sure would not go away with the 10% break in of the interior pads. So I sent it back and got the extra large and it feels so much better. This is my first buying experience with RevZilla and I am really impressed with them. When I called about the helmet exchange, I talked to a very friendly and helpful staff member and then was sent a return shipping label to my email for free return shipping. And then the new helmet was sent to me also free of charge. I will continue to purchase from RevZilla in the future.\n",

      "I've been wearing a 1/2 helmet with 1/2 face shield, but I wanted to move to something with more coverage (and quieter). I'm not comfortable with a full face helmet, but this was a great compromise. It's very quiet (compared to the 1/2 helmet). I wear contacts, and I've always needed to wear googles to prevent dry eyes. I don't think I'll need them with this helmet. It's true, the Harley speakers don't fit exactly in the designated spot, but they fit well enough -- no problems so far. At first, the fit was tight, and I planned to order the thinner cheek pads. After several rides, I've decided that won't be necessary. The fit is snug, but not tight. All in all, I love the helmet.\n",

      "My head measurement is about 25\", so it is difficult to find a decent helmet that fits.The Shoei J-Cruise, size 2x fits me well (I think). Being that my previous helmet was to large, I am not used to the tight fit. With time the tightness should decrease by 10%, so I should be an ok .I wear glasses (trifocals), and it is difficult for the glasses to fit properly (distorted image), and have yet to find a solution to correct it. Perhaps cutting an opening for the frames to slide in.It is wonderful to have a built-in sun shade. It works well, and don't have to worry about switching to sunglasses. It is a real blessing.The air flow is wonderful and can't wait for the summer to see how efficient it is.\n",

      "I wear prescription glasses and need the sun shield visor. My previous helmet (HJC CL-33) had one too, but it felt cheap and was loud inside the helmet during disengagement. The J-Cruise sun shield is smooth and quiet.The helmet is obviously superior in quality (which is why I was willing to spend SO MUCH money for it), but it still has some room for improvement:Fit: the right cheek pad pushes against my right ear and becomes uncomfortable on longer rides. I talked with a Shoei rep at the Progressive International Motorcycle show about it: He said to remove the cheek pad and cut out the pressure point (!). Seems like there should be a better solution when you pay nearly $500 for a helmet.Finish: I got the matte black finish, which looked great with my bike… for the first few days, but the fingerprints don't seem to want to clean off. I used the recommended mild dishwashing liquid and a microfiber cloth, but it seems like it may be a permanent stain. That is disappointing.\n",

      "The Bell Mag-9 is a righteous helmet on its own, especially with the integrated Sena Port. But, since I was upgrading to the 20S in parallel, I took a look at the J-Cruise, being happy with it's full face brethren the GT Air. Fit is only slightly less snug, as one would expect in the lower cheek region than the Air. The fit and finish is aligned 100% with Shoei's attention to quality and detail. The pinlock (which is NOT included as it is with the GT Air) provides one of the widest fog-free views I've ever seen... until you put down the integrated sun visor in cool weather where it instantly fogs. That's the only negative point I'll give it considering there are 'mostly' permanent coatings (i.e. Scorpion's lenses) that exist with today's technology.\n",

      "I ruminated over several open face 3/4 helmets of high quality and features such as the Joe Rocket Carbon helmet, the Arai XC and CT-Z, and the Shoei J-Cruise. Finally I made my mind and bought the J-Cruise. The reasons were 1- I already own a Shoei RF200 which fit me really well, so the risk of getting the wrong head shape was nil. 2- The Arai products are significantly more expensive (CT-Z), or do not have removable washable liner (XC), and neither have sun visors (I am sure for all the good safety first reasons). 3-The Joe Rocket seemed like an excellent choice in terms of shell quality and price, but there was a risk of poor fitment since it is for a rounder head shape, and the reviews on the quality of the liner were not great. So I bit the bullet and ordered the expensive, but feature-rich Shoie J-Cruise.Maybe I still had second thoughts but that was before taking it out and using it... The helmet fits my intermediate oval 60 cm head perfectly in LG size. Very comfortable. Although at my age sunlight does not seem to bother me as much as when I was in my 20s,30s, the sun visor is great and deploys easily. I used it when riding towards the sun several times, and was happy to have it. I did not expect to have a quiet open face helmet, since my old GMax I got as bonus with my first used bike was very noisy. I had gotten used to ear plugs anyways. To my surprise the J-Cruise muffled sound really well, perhaps because of choice of materials or because of better shell or liner design. There is less wind noise than my old helmet, which tells me it has better aerodynamics. I still like to wear ear plugs for long rides, as I think it cuts back on distractions and fatigue. Finally on color choices, I bought a white helmet which I think is a good compromise of good visibility and all color matching.\n",

      "1200GSA, 90% slabA few things to consider with the J-Cruise.Size/fit: different from the RF-1000/1200. Large has been a perfect fit for me but a LG J-Cruise was unbearable. Pressure points at the frontal and high temples. This was not going to go away with a 10% break-in. I had to go with an XL and of-course, its a bit loose; not floppy or dangerous, but not track-helmet snug. I'd suggest measuring and if you are in the gray zone, go with the next size up. That said, Revzilla is awesome to work with if you need to return things.Features: As good as it gets save for a bluetooth system like N-Com. The optics on the shield and visor are stellar. Even with the pinlock insert I can look through all 3 layers and not have much distortion. Ventilation is good. Comfort of the liner and chin strap are top-notch. Easy to install a com-system. The sun visor is cable operated and very smooth.Balance: Not as balanced on the head as most Ar**s but pretty good. Its hard to judge with a slightly larger fit than I need so I'll leave this for others. COG feels a touch high.Finish: Brilliant paint, good plastics on the vent construction, double rubber bead for the visor seal, no imperfections that I could find. Vent movement is solid. Shield snaps into place in the lower left corner with a pin/hole latch. Top notch.Use: Compared to Arai removing/replacing a Shoei shield is a snap. Autocom earphones fit well into the recesses WITH 1/4\" pad insert from Autocom. Otherwise they are likely to be too far from your ears. Not sure what speakers Shoei had in mind with these cut-out recesses. And detents...Shoei come on!!! All the way up or all the way down?Overall: Great helmet. Just ordered one for my girlfriend tonight. Get the size right and most people will love this helmet. And for the record...look at the data (PubMed or Goggle Scholar) - open face vs full-face has very little effect on craniofacial injury or severity of TBI. If this helmet fits you properly, protection should be on par with most full-face helmets, unless you slide on your face with the shield open. Just saying...\n",

Vents in the helmet even keep my head comfortable down in 98+ high humidity South GA heat. The interior is very comfortable and removable for washing. The anthracite color is beautiful. Picture doesn't do it justice. Already has ear pockets for speakers if you want to install bluetooth headset.\n",

      "This helmet provides great comfort and features.\n",
      "I specifically purchased this helmet to replace another because of the Sun Shield behind the Face Shield feature. The Sun Shield works great, fits glasses without interference and is protected from bugs by the clear face shield. The air flow thru the vents has worked great for me even with temps in the low 90's but I do not use a windshield on my bike. This Helmet's shields are so clear it is like they are not even there, when clean. The J-Cruise is comfortable to wear on all day rides.\n",

      "Great helmet but low on flow\n",
      "I had been looking at getting a new helmet with a built in flip down visor. I had also been thinking about a new 3/4 helmet. When I saw the J-Cruise combining the two features, I figured it had to be fate.I have now been using this helmet for about 3 weeks. My other helmets for comparison sake are: Bell Star, Bell Rogue, Shoei RF-1100.This helmet fits comfortably if not slightly narrower than the RF-1000. Maybe its because its a 3/4 but the cheek pads were very tight at first but broke in a little better over a few rides. The vision is absolutely exceptional. I have never worn a helmet that, litterally, nothing obscured my line of sight. I know the helmet is on my head, but I cant see it at all. This is great because I dont have to move my head as much to see things around a corner or behind me. The other really nice thing is how long the front shield is. Again, it comes down so low you cant see the bottom of it. This is great because the guages on my Harley are a lot closer to me than on my Ducati. I just glance down and theres my speedo. Cant do that with any of my full faced helmets.The visor is really trick and works very well. The mechanism is easy to use even with gloves on. However, sometimes when I hit a big bump, it will make the visor jump a little in place. It is very clear though and comes down right above the bridge of the nose. It doesn't fall right into the bottom line of sight like I have read many others do.Last thing and where I have an issue with this helmet, airflow. The airflow over the top of the helmet is great, as is every Shoei I have had. However, there is virtually no airflow to the face inside the helmet. Under 30 miles an hour you are pretty much breathing in your own exhale. Maybe Im just used to helmets with a chin bar vent that has the air going right to the mouth or nose but this is virtually nonexistant. I have found myself flipping the shield up when riding around and putting the internal visor down for protection. This works decently well but obviously isnt going to protect your face if any debris is thrown up at it. On the extremely humid and hot days we have gotten here in the past couple weeks, I just cannot wear this helmet during those times.I do recommend this helmet and I can see myself using it more often in weather lower than mid 80's. Anything higher though and I need my Rogue or Star for better airflow.\n",

      "Great 3/4 Helmet, Wish it cost less!\n",
      "I love this helmet! I waited a long time to buy a new helmet and I couldn't be happier with the Shoei J-Cruise. This helmet is very comfortable, and very quiet. The medium fits me perfectly. My previous helmet is a Shoei and lasted me many years. Shoeis seem to fit my head best. I was trying to avoid paying this much for a new helmet, but at least I know Shoei is a good, long term investment.The wide visibility is fantastic. I can see much more without moving my head than with a full face helmet. You feel like your head is in a fish bowl instead of a helmet. Plus it has the internal flip down sun visor, so you don't need sunglasses.The air flow is great. I could feel the air flowing over the top of my head. I ride in hot Texas weather. I just rode today, July 4th, and my head never felt hot.I was concerned (before use) that the open face might cause air lift at higher speeds, but this was not the case. I could turn my head side to side, up & down, at high speeds and the helmet never moved. No wind noise either.RevZilla CS was very helpful with selection and ordering. I ordered on Saturday, it shipped Monday, I received it Wednesday. What more could you ask with free shipping?This is a great 3/4 helmet. I wish it cost less, but Shoei is a high quality manufacturer and I know I'll be using the J-Cruise for a long time.\n",

      "fits me well, materials good quality. I was surprised how loud the wind noise is when the shield is all the way down, seems to howl at the top where shield meets rubber seal above , maybe that's why the give you silicone to apply? And actually when the shield is all the way down, I seem to get less facial air flow then I do on my full face helmet, especially since you can crack the shield open like on a full face. I do love the dark inner shield that flips down so I don't need to wear glasses.\n",

      "Cream of the crop in 3/4 open-faced helmets\n",
      "If you've got a Shoei-shaped head (you know who you are) and if you're looking for a 3/4 open-faced helmet, this is the one for you. I wanted an open face helmet that would, 1) fit me, 2) provide a clear shield for those inevitable rain showers, and 3) provide an internal shaded eye shield. The J-Cruise has all three.• The Shoei fit is legendary and this helmet is no exception. Removable interior lining is typically Shoei-plush too.• The vents on this helmet REALLY flow some air! The only downside to this is that, with the front vent open there is noticeably more noise.• The oversized clear shield can be used open or closed. The seems to come down a bit lower than most open-face shields and terminates at the bottom with a spoiler lip, which does an excellent job of keeping rain at bay. The shield is also a compact, streamlined design, which doesn't protrude outward from the helmet. It is designed to accommodate a Pinlock inner shield to combat fogging, but I doubt this open face helmet will ever present a fogging issue. My only complaint is that I wish it had multiple intermediate position detents, but alas, it's there's only full open or full closed.• Fitting a J&M Elite 629 headset was a bit of a chore, as the molded-in pockets were not deep enough to accommodate the speakers without some judicious trimming. Once installed however they sounded marvelous. CAUTION: J&M offers two different 629 speaker designs; one utilizes hollow rubber stalks that surround the wires that come out of the speaker, which are actually supposed to enhance the bass sound. The other has vents in the back of the speaker and no stalks. On this particular helmet, the version with the stalks will NOT work properly. They will sound completely void of bass response. A call to J&M sorted this out and now they sound great with the vented models.Overall, this is a premium open-faced helmet (at a premium price). Although it will not provide the protection of a full-face helmet, it is as good as it gets in an open face, and light years ahead of any other open-face on the market in my opinion. If you're looking for the freedom that comes with an open face then look no further. I use it for touring on the Goldwing and don't believe I could have made a better choice.\n",

They said both would do welll (open afterall) so it came down to features. The Shoei has a sunvisor and the Arai does not. I went with the Shoei based on that and excellent expierence with other Shoei helmets\n",

I am continuously annoyed by the pricing, but always overwhelmed with the design, quality and fit. Frankly, I love Shoei helmets and this one has exceeded even my expectations.It is beautiful, functional and is very comfortable. However, we expect that and particularly for the price. The surprises for me were in two areas: quietness and viewing area. I expected a 3/4 helmet to have significantly higher noise levels. Somehow, the engineers figured out how to beat that problem. The viewing area is nothing short of amazing (and I love the locking mechanism on the shield). The shield is the best I've experienced in 45 years of riding.The only minor nitpick I have with Shoei beyond pricing is the airflow issue. It could always have been a little better in all of their helmets I have owned (4 of them).I would highly recommend this helmet without any reservations and wouldn't hesitate to buy another one (with a loan of course!).\n",

      "The reviews for this product all tell the tale— high quality, amazing fit and finish, INSANELY light, reasonably feature packed. Exactly what you’d expect out of Shoei’s premier offering. I had three really cool surprise moments worth sharing, as they didn’t stand out in any past reviews. 1) This helmet is QUIET. I switched from an RF1200 that I had for nearly 5 years and over 50k miles, which is more of a sports touring helmet than a true sport. I expected the X14 to be louder with all of the additional air flow inside, plus the aerodynamics of the shell— I was way, way WRONG. Even without a chin skirt, it’s so much more quiet that I remark about it (to myself) at least once per ride. 2) So very light!You can read the weight differences on paper, but until it’s on your head, they won’t be clear. This helmet is also insanely well balanced, so it carries the meager weight better than other brands I’ve tried (in limited capacity) in the past. Furthermore, the aero’s keep the buffeting down so much that you don’t ever feel any weight even during head checks or at higher speeds when not tucked fully behind the screen. 3) Pad adjustment for fit angle is SO clutch. I had no clue that you could shift the angle of some of the pads to provide for a “race” fit, giving you a higher/better field of view in various levels of tighter tucks than you’d achieve on the street. It’ll be a few weeks before I can put the helmet through it’s first track day, but I did play around with this feature and it seems to make an obvious difference. Every other positive from the other reviews is also accurate, and I’ve yet to find a negative. Super happy with the X14!\n",

Anyway, since then it has definitely broken in quite a bit and it no longer hurts (or my head shrank who knows). Main reason I got this helmet is because I needed the race view which it totally delivered on, and I had an RF-1200 save my life (so an upgrade should be even better!).I have yet to go down in it but I can't imagine there would be any lasting injury if I did.

(\"thermoplastic,\" is just plastic nothing special) the helmet does feel heavy after an hour of riding with the chin bar in the up position you can feel the extra weight in back of your head. over all the this helmet is comfortable, and the features are great to go from full face helmet to being able to ride with it open and the wind not catching on the chin bar, also visor goes up automatically when chin bar is lifted up awesome idea. but like i said craftsmanship and  quality sucks for the price. it is a good summer helmet, i would not buy this helmet again. the idea and style  is great i would wait to a different manufacture with higher quality and standard develops a similar great idea of having the chin bar all the way to back\n",

Getting the clip on takes a bit of effort but it is secure and does not move.I've worn medium helmets in the past but this one seems to be extremely snug. I'm hoping over time as I break it in more it will get more comfortable.The modular mechanism is easy to operate with gloves on. I do not have any issue with opening/closing it, just read the instructions that come with the helmet and you will be fine.If this helmet lasts a long time I'll definitely buy another.\n",

      "Too notch! Build quality is very good! Mechanism works distinctly and smoothly.My head is 23\" but big forehead and quite narrow from the sides skull. I found \"L\" quite loose both from the sides and back of the head, so I ordered \"M\" - it fits perfectly! Little bit tight at the jaw, but after using it a week I've got used to it and now feel comfortable.Awesom thing is that M size has significantly smaller shell, then \"L\": about an inch in each three dimensions! Now I look neat. In \"L\" I resemble a cosmonaut :DI love Pinlock! It's make a difference! And they supply it with the helmet!A spoon of tar. It was a big disappointment that no convenient bluetooth headset could be installed in it! Only Sharktooth fits preexisting slots. But Sharktooth is outdated :(\n",

      "My basic perception\n",
      "This is just my second modular, the other being a lower priced HCJ. The chin-guard portion is just to cut the wind.  On the $200 HJC, it feels like it might actually protect you in a crash to some extent, especially with the solid locking mechanism. On the Shark, I have to press it down with both hands  to achieve a solid lock, and I can't/won't do that at speed. At any rate, it just a wind-guard. Flimsy and poorly actuated--likely just a bunch of plastic to embed in your face if you crash. The aerodynamic qualities of this are superb when pushed back. The visor comes down lower than most modulars and until you reach 80 or so on a naked bike, you don't have to tuck your head much to keep it from feeling like a sail. It fits and feels great, though I'd like more venting on the front when locked down and an easier connection. The sun visor works well enough, but I like the pushbutton spring  retract on the HJC more.\n",

      "Bar None: THE BEST modular design available - but very low quality build\n",
      "SUMMARY:++ ABSOLUTELY the BEST modular design out there.++ Terrible build and quality control issues overall.THE LONG WINDED VERSION:I've owned the Shark Evoline 3 Pro DAKAR carbon fiber helmet for 2 years now.  This is the upgraded Evoline 3 Pro that eventually became the Evo ONE 2 in the U.S. market.   The Evo ONE 2 has some very minor updates to the DAKAR version, but otherwise is the same helmet.First off - the Shark Modular design is in my opinion the ABSOLUTE BEST design out there.  With the open mode, the helmet is more balanced and aerodynamic.  It's entirely feasible and comfortable to ride in the \"jet mode\" (open) at lower speeds, city, etc. and be able to enjoy the more open face position. In the closed position the helmet is \"ok\", it's still a modular, so you'll get a bit more noise than a full face design, and more windage (i.e. no chin curtain, etc.).  Keep that in mind ... it's still a modular. I absolutely want to love this helmet and shout to the world to buy it.  Sadly though - I've had so many minor quality issues with it .... it just hurts thinking how \"if only\" they could have upped the quality.   You'll see several of the same themes with quality issues in the other reviews.  Here's my list .... * Trim pieces come unglued and loose - I've had to reglue trim pieces at least 3 or 4 times, and I have more loose that I've just given up on* The chin bar rotation mechanism is extremely \"sticky\" and hard to operate sometimes - and over time, has gotten a LOT worse than original use* The visor seals with an extremely stiff rubber gasket at the top - but the rubber is so bad that it causes scratching of the visor over time - and YES, I've been using the rubber gasket fluid on it religiously* It fogs up heavily (my version does not have the current Evo ONE 2 much needed Pinlock)* Taking the visor shield on/off isn't too hard, but requires the use of a \"sharp pokey\" think - which always terrifies me I'm going to slip and scratch the visor*  Re-installing the integrated sun shield after cleaning is a complete nightmare - it can take 10 to 15 minutes to do it sometimes ... and usually I just skip cleaning it correctly because of this ... *  The cheakpad snaps on the left side are slightly misaligned, so not all 3 of the snaps can snap closed - only 2 ... minor issue, as the pad still stays firmly in place ... but ... cheap quality control issue* the airflow is absolutely miserable in closed mode - it's basically completely useless and nonexistent - apparently airflow has been updated in the Evo ONE 2 version* removing the internal liner always makes me worry I'm going to rip it - as it requires significant force to yank on the attachment points to remove it *** Visibility is pretty poor - the view port is \"average\" - which in my opinion is NOT sufficient in today's world - they DEFINITELY need to increase the vision port size a bit - especially for side view*** The helmet is pretty heavy - it is a modular, so expect it to be heavier than a full face helmet.  However - I still feel they need to shave somewhere between .25 to .50 pounds off the helmet weight to get it down to 3.25 pounds or so.WORSE ... I have emailed Shark with many multi-page feedback messages and details.  I've offered comprehensive overview, coupled with several suggestions on how to make things better.   I believe I've sent 6 messages now -and not a single time does anyone reply - not even a form letter \"thank you for contacting us\"...   I really really wish shark would go under ... and a high end quality brand picks up their designs on the cheap - and starts to build a QUALITY version of the Evo ONE 2.  IMO - this is the best modular design out there that just lacks on execution and quality control.\n",

      "BLUF: I should have returned this helmet as soon as I saw how big it was and how cheap it felt.  Pretty sure it's too late now having used it for about 500 miles.It should have been obvious to me that the helmet would be big given that it's modular and has an integrated sun visor.  If you're a person of small stature, you *will* look like a bobble head with this helmet.The first things I noticed when I opened the box were how big the helmet was and how cheap it felt.  The \"EVO ONE\" logo plates on each side have fallen off several times (amazingly always in my driveway, I think as I was taking the helmet off... I finally just Gorilla glued them on), and the chin bar mechanism doesn't want to come forward most of the time.  I have to grab it and wiggle it while pulling it forward to get it to swing into place.  It operates better when the helmet isn't on my head, though, which means that the helmet must be flexing and causing the mechanism to bind when it *is* on my head.  I've wondered if maybe the helmet is too small for me, but it's comfortable otherwise and the same size I've always worn.It's fairly comfortable on it's own, but a little loud on the freeway doesn't have much room around the ears.  If you have earplugs with stems that stick out a bit, the padding will either lean them over to one side or push them into your ears.The airflow isn't too bad, I can at least feel a very light breeze on my face and head at speed, but it feels more like just random puffs of air and not an efficient flow.Overall, I've decided since I just about never use the thing in open-face mode anyway, I should have gone with the Shoei RF-1200 for just a tiny bit more money.  Lesson learned...\n",

      "I have a lot of helmets.  Shoei Neotec, AGV Sport Modular, Aria RX-Q, Bell, HJC, Speed and Strength, and I’m sure I’m forgetting something. Point is I have ridden in a lot of different lids.  For sitting position reference, I ride an 2017 Indian Roadmaster, a 1999 Honda Valkyrie, and a 2004 Honda Rune.For around town, the Shark EVO One 2 has become my go to helmet.  I live in the country, so in back roads where I rarely see a car, I leave the chin bar back to get more air.  When I hit traffic, or jump on the highway, I just click the bar into place, and I’m secure in a full face.The chin bar locking mechanism is a bit tricky at first, but gets better and easier over time.  Opening it is a breeze.  The internal sunshield works well, and can even be used with sunglasses if it’s super bright out. Comfort is good, as is airflow.  Noise is neither horrible nor silent.  Louder than the AGV or Neotec, but not annoyingly loud.The only complaints are that the ‘city’ position on the shield tends to pop closed at speed, as the stock shield seems a bit flimsy.  In addition, the helmet feels heavy.  I don’t know what it weighs, but it seems heavier than my other helmets.  Probably due to the mechanisms, but whatever the cause, it feels clunky after about an hour.All that being said, I think it’s a cool new helmet that offers a lot of versatility.  I would buy another one if this one was stolen/lost/etc...\n",

      "This is my second Shark helmet and I'm impressed with the changes. This is basically the EVO 3 updated. Contrary to the product listing the pinlock lens is actually included and is a welcome add-on. Shark helmets take a few weeks to break in so it feels tight initially but eyeglasses fit on painlessly. It is easy to convert while riding and very quiet. I've tried the top of the line helmets (Harley and Shoei) and this is the best I've found!\n",

      "Very good helmet made from the latest technology. Outer visor and sun shield work together perfectly. Not the quietest helmet for riding on the “freeway” even tho it’s named the “Freeway” helmet. Shoulder checks do pull at your head. You will get a good neck workout and feel it the next day.

      "Ive got good new and bad news..\n",
      "The good news is: The ariflow in this helmet is excellent. Pulling the mouth intake down all the way, its almost as if you're not even wearing a helmet - I was very impressed. Getting kind of drafty? You can adjust the intakes on the mouth and head inlets to perfectly suit your comfort level. The fit and feel of the helmet is great as well. This will differ by individual obviously, but for me, this helmet has a very firm but comfortable and high-quality feel that allows you to move your head around without any play whatsoever. Its as if this helmet *is* your head. And that's where the bad news starts because if this helmet were your head, it would be a big and heavy one. Yes, its technically average weight at 3.53 lbs but something about it just feels bullky and sluggish - it's also physically larger than previous helmets Ive owned like the Shoei RX1200 and a cheaper Scorpion helmet (forget which one it was). That said all that extra bulk and padding would probably be in your favor in case of a collision, but its definitely a trade-off you have to be willing to make. Lastly, is the face shield. I had not owned a helmet with a face-shield before and always found it annoying to wear sunglasses under the visor or constantly swap visors for day/night riding so I was excited about the drop down visor. Major disappointment there. The visor is not quite dark enough to keep you (me, at least) comfortable in glaring sun, but to make matters worse, it doesnt come down far enough to fully cover your field of vision (even with the adjustable visor setting option). The worst part if that even with the visor all the way down, you can still see the bottom edge of the visor in your field of vision and it actually pretty distracting while youre riding.. you kinda have to actively ignore it and frankly, having to do so is kind of a safety hazard. And the was the last straw for me. Despite being a bit ambivalent about returning this very comfortable helmet with excellent airflow and a premium feel, I just shipped it back out to Revzilla and will probably pick up another Shoei.\n",

      "Good value with plenty of style\n",
      "As a new rider, I did plenty of research before purchasing my helmet. I ride a street triple so I needed a helmet that would work well for mostly upright riding during my commute and some spirited riding on occasion...eventually. The T-1200 seemed to fit the bill nicely and at an approachable price. Having ridden with it for almost 2 years now I feel I can give you a good idea of what works and what doesn't.The good:The helmet is safe. Others can attest to it's protection during crashes in their reviews. Thankfully, I have not had to verify this. The style (matte black/gloss black freeway) of this helmet is fantastic. It's a head turner for sure...more on that in the 'bad\".The drop down visor works great. It does not cover the bottom of your field of vision but, it works well for me as is. Great ventilation with easy to use vent toggles. The not so good:The helmet is loud. I don't use a comm and rarely use earplugs unless I a riding long distances. My commute is short and my aftermarket exhaust is loud anyway so it's not a deal breaker. If you do ride for extended periods then I highly recommend using ear protection. With the vents closed the top channels act like sails and really strain my neck on long rides, even at moderate speeds. This is by far the most disliked aspect of riding with this helmet for me. The wind also catches the helmet on head checks on the highway which add to the neck strain...hence, head turner... The top vents whistle loudly sometimes during head checks at highway speeds. This scared the c%#p out of me the first few times it happened. As a new rider especially, this was not cool. I had to purchase a race shield to step up to a pinlock system for cold weather riding. The stock face shield fogs up a lot. Pinlock is a must have.  With all the vents closed I noticed significant air still makes it past the shield and the chin curtain. Upon further inspection, the shield does not make a tight seal with the gasket in all areas. This in not a big deal in warm weather riding but, in cold weather it's disappointing. During my first winter I wore a balaclava each time I rode. Come spring, the padding inside must have adapted to the added thickness and now the helmet feels loose. I could purchase a new liner set but, instead I purchased a new Arai helmet for spring-fall riding and will use this helmet w/ my balaclava for winter riding exclusively. I did tape over the vents on top to eliminate the sail like properties of the helmet on the highway which worked out nicely. Overall, on paper and in the video review it's a great value. I could not have known in would fall short the way it did until after riding in it over a long period of time. If you can justify a few more dollars for a solid Shoei rf-1200, that might be a better option IMO. Thanks for reading my review and I hope it helps you out.\n",

      "This helmet looks great IMO. With the drop down sun visor it is pretty flex able for any time of day. The chin vent flows a ton of air, but I found whistles on the highway. This is fixed by only riding with it on the first open position. The visor doesn't fog much even when sitting still in cold rainy days. Being able to ride with the visor in a dedicated cracked open position really helps this.  The chin curtain doesn't do much to keep the cold, dirt, or the occasional bug out. I have to ride with earplugs because I think the wind noise is a bit much. I was able to put a sena com unit in and the pockets for he ear phones are a bit tight. The adjustable cheek pads and emergency removal system are nice touches.I had a low side crash recently and while my sup order took the brunt, my head did tap off the pavement. I didn't feel anything other than a light thud.\n",

      "I bought this to replace my Icon Airmada.  The fit is great especially with the inflatable cheek pads, it makes it super snug and comfortable just to your liking.  The graphics look sick in person, the pictures don't do it justice.  I wanted a helmet with the internal sunvisor and pockets for my Sena 20s, this has both.  I replaced the clear shield with the gold mirror - I use it until it gets dark - and although I initially bought this so I wouldn't have to carry a shield, the gold just looks WAY too sexy to not rock it.  My bike is black with gold forks and gold accents so it matches perfectly.  Airflow is pretty good and as far as the noise, other than my Sena either playing music or being used to communicate w fellow riders, I don't have anything else in my ears.  I probably could ride w plugs but it doesn't bother me and I ride a naked style bike.  The included chin curtain adds to the wind/noise reduction and increases that comfortable feel and fit, and the vents/shield lock are easily accessible with gloves.I'm considering buying the white and black model bc I'm picking up a new bike which is black and white.  It'll be tough for me to ever buy another helmet that isn't a Scorpion.  I ordered this and an HJC RPHA ST at the same time and although the HJC was comfortable, this helmet blew it out of the water top to bottom.If you're on the fence, buy it. You won't regret it.  I get complements everywhere I ride.  If you have ANY gold on your bike, spend the extra 40/50 And pick up the gold mirror visor.  Aside from function it increases your visibility so more drivers notice you and I haven't noticed any adverse effects on my vision with it on.  Shield replacement is SUPER easy, btw.  A huge complaint I had w my Icon bc of the side clips, this is a 10 second swap of the shield.  Sorry if this was all over the place but I felt the need to leave a review for such a great product.

It is really comfortable, the padding is great, absorbs sweat very well and airflow is nice. The internal drop down shade is an awesome feature too if you don't want to mess with sunglasses. Some people complained that it is loud. I can't really compare to other helmets but riding in a city, I like to hear what is going on around me but when tearing down the highway at 70 mph on a Harley, I kinda wish I had some ear plugs. This helmet seems pricey for some but its money well spent. How much is it worth to protect your head and keep the mushy contents inside?

I mean, I read about it, but I didn't think it could be worse than an entry-level helmet. Oh my god, was I wrong. If you have a windshield on a touring bike, it may be no issue. But on my sport bike, there is a GOD AWFUL whistle.

I notice my favorite most comfortable hats more then this helmet. For the noise folks I have to say you may have a defective product. It is not the horror story people have written about. This sub $400 helmet is quieter then my old $800 helmet. The $800 helmet should claim was it was silent on the road. It had three times the noise this scorpion helmet has. The drop down visor is a money saver. I've bought the gold face shield because of the look then function. I haven't even put it on because of the drop down visor. I say money saver because I won't need to have my sunglasses on my head in which I'll put them down somewhere and forget them. Sure there are better helmets out there. There's always something better gen what you own. This helmet for the price is spot on. It's my first time with scorpion and in 4 years they will be the first brand I look at. RevZilla your detailed videos sell the products. No guy on YouTube doing his own video which has audio you can't hear and video so bad you don't know what your watching.

      "Upgraded to the T1200 freeway from an Icon alliance that I've used for about 4 years (great helmet for the price as well). That being said, this is an excellent helmet for the price. It looks awesome with the graphics without being too much, the liner is crazy soft and comfortable and tons and tons of airflow. Oh and the internal visor is a huge plus, especially for me since i'd rather not ride with sunglasses but like the option to flip them on and off at will (there is adjustability for how low they come down which I was impressed with). I fit this helmet with a SENA 10R, the installation was seamless and the speaker cutouts match exactly. That being said, this helmet is LOUD in the sense that it has excellent airflow at a cost of tons of wind noise inside. I ride an FZ-09 which probably doesn't help as well, there's noise at almost all speeds and especially at highway speeds (no helmet will be entirely quiet) I've decided to pick up some decent noise filtering plugs for this purpose. The graphics look cool but I don't have too much confidence on the durability seeing as they've already kinda chipped after 2 weeks. I would definitely recommend this helmet at this price point though, great option for casual commuting/aggressive street riders alike.\n",

Had up to 185ish mph and extremely stable on hayabusa. Now the negatives. Loudest helmet I've ever worn. On the hayabusa most helmets are loud but if the air hits just right the vents whistle like those anti deer things on car bumpers. If you turn your head just right/wrong it has a rumble that sounds like a deflating balloon or whoopie cushion. Scared me half to death first time.  On my fjr1300, this is very evident no matter the windshield or position of it. My only gripe with the helmet. Ventilation is awesome but at a price. Wear ear plugs. Shoei gt air has all the same niceties and very quiet. But also at a price.\n",

      "This is my second Scorpion helmet. I've put a LOT of miles on this helmet and here are some of my issues:1. That realllllly comfy liner comes with one serious drawback: The vinyl on the bottom doesn't come out far enough on the cheekpads and it will turn it into a friggin' SPONGE for us Pac NW riders (you either ride in the rain, or you ride maybe two days a year). On the way from Seattle to Portland, I was freezing because my cheekpads were soaked through.2. The little vents on the top... if you wear this thing for non-sportbike rides (I usually run a Suzuki GSXr, but I also have a cruiser for distance runs where I'm worried my ride could get ripped off), the vent whistles. I thought something was wrong with my bike at first, but it turns out the vent was creating a kazoo-like noise. I'm not sure if there was something wrong with mine, but it's a bit annoying.3. My old 900 was all setup for Bluetooth... this one, not so much.Past those minor things, I'd highly recommend this helmet. It's done me right for a lot of miles.I'm looking at replacing this helmet (only due to a low-side slide that scratched up the front of it a little) and I'm going to miss it.I always got compliments on this helmet, and it IS comfortable. I just hope they iron out these minor issues with the next update!\n",

      "The small size helmet was a very tight fit for my 56 cm head. In hindsight a medium may of been the better option. The fit is getting better as it is taking the shape of my head now, after a few weeks of use. It claimed to have good wind noise resistance this is not true. It is a very noisy helmet at 100 kilometers an hour but no worse than my AVG which cost $100 more. I ride a naked bike so I expect some wind noise. Overall it is not a bad helmet.\n",

      "For reference, my last helmet was the Scorpion EXO-750 Vintage.  I loved loved loved that helmet but it was time to retire it and the EXO-T1200 was the least obnoxious graphic and in my ideal price range.  By comparison, the T-12 seems a bit louder (I always ride with ear plugs) and puts a little bit more pressure on my brow ridge but as the helmet has broken in, it's gotten much more comfortable.  I like the drop-down inner visor which is clear and easy to operate.  What I don't like is the \"city\" lever to crack open the visor a little bit...it doesn't really open the visor enough to make much difference...my old 750 had a much better lever operation and function.  I do find that for the money, Scorpion really has the best comfort liners and overall build quality.   I do however have a major issue with the tinted visor that I purchased separately which I have reviewed as well..\n",

The fit is nice and snug for me. This helmet did save my life. On May 13, I was in an accident with a vehicle. Traveling between 40-50 mph a car pulled out in front of me. Bike was totaled and the helmet was all scratched up. Paramedics were impressed with the inflating cheek pads. In the ER I was know as the guy that had the helmet with air bags.

This is not the highest end helmet but is a good bang for your buck type helmet. The Reebok \"Pump\" style cheeks pads are a nice touch and the helmet looks bad-[expletive]. The clear visor with the inner \"fighter pilot\" lens is perfect for day rides that last into the night. With my old helmet I would use a dark visor for the daytime and get \"stuck\" riding into the evening with visibility becoming an issue with the tinted visor at night. Problem solved with the Freeway. The sound is not the best but a marked improvement over my entry level helmet. Overall it was a good purchase for the price.\n",

I liked it so much I thought about trying to make it fit by getting a helmet much larger than my head and just using it. Returned with no questions asked by the RevZilla team.

      "Scorpion EXO T1200 Helmet; ‘Freeway’ gloss/matte, medium. This is a sexy graphic. No, I ain’t in love with it, but I do love it! Form, fit, and function is awesome. The vents, shields (both primary & inner) work very well even with gloved hands. Takes a bit of getting used to as I inadvertently locked the shield down a couple of times while attempting to lower the tinted shield for afternoon glare reduction. Not a big deal, but it caused a moment of distraction when rolling to a stop at a light thinking that I was about to raise the shield and nearly pushed myself off the bike… ok, I agree, that would have been a big deal. The air pump is easy to adjust. It does exactly what is claimed; assuming that you picked the proper fit, if you jack the pressure up on this system, it will squeeze about as much on your gourd as you’re likely going to want. Regarding the numerous complaints about noise, I’m not sure that it’s any louder than any of the other dozen helmets I’ve owned for road duty. Keep in mind, I’m riding a ZX6R so my wind protection is minimal compared to many touring riders. I opt to wear ear plugs anyway, although I did blast around just during a leisure stroll without plugs to see what the hype was about. Personally, I think the T1200 was given a bad rap. I’m not saying the critics were wrong, only that in my experience I don’t agree. I’m curious what brand and model of helmet these folks are accustomed to. Obviously, I’ve not yet owned one of these supposedly sound proof buckets… I do offer a strong recommendation of the T1200 helmet.Safety bonus: I purchased black retro-reflective ¼” tape and carefully lined it for low visibility riding conditions (see pics). In the daytime, the tape is nearly undetectable, but when struck with light (as seen from cell phone flash, it pops). Source: “FindTape.com” 3M Scotch Scotchlite Reflective Striping Tape (Black) ¼” X 50 ft at $18.47. Note, this product is double sided. Once cut to length and applied, it can be difficult to lift the protective sheath. I used my fingernail to pick at it. At first, I thought I was ruining it and was about to just lose patience and tear the strip completely off again. That’s when I discovered, this is some hardy stuff and stayed put very well even when trimmed to sharp angles. The sheath finally gave way and peeled back exposing a very clean, precise line that blended perfectly with the Freeway graphic. Safe Riding!\n",

      "This helmet has served me extremely well, and the \"Freeway\" graphic looks amazing. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a lightweight helmet with good airflow and features.I purchased this helmet because I wanted good airflow, protection, and premium features for the price. The video reviews on revzilla were extremely helpful in making my decision. In a nutshell, the helmet delivered on everything I was looking for. Additionally, the fact that it is light weight has proven to be an added bonus that I really appreciate. The airflow is great! I feel it working as I ride and it really helps keep me cool. I run really hot, no matter what the weather, so this is a great feature for me. The spoiler on the helmet really adds to the look as well as its airflow.The comfort liner is impressively comfortable (as its name entails) and soft to the touch. A chin removable curtain is included as well as a cleaning kit and some chemicals for the face shield. The anti-fog coating does do what it is supposed to, but can cause some halos to show up on lights. I have not had a problem with this however. Pinlock shield are becoming available for this helmet, and after using one on a different helmet, I really want to do the same for this one. I only dropped it down by one level on the features column, just because I wish it shipped with a pinlock shield.This helmet is great for both really hot and really cold days, and I am very happy with it. I would recommend this helmet to anyone looking for a great full face helmet.\n",

      "This helmet replaced my EXO-700 that I've worn for the last 8 years. The fit is spot on to the size chart. Below 50mph it is considerably more quiet than the 700, above 50mph it's just as loud, but with a different tone. More of a woosh like when you just crack a window in your car. Completly tolerable, though. Love the internal sun visor, but it creates a compromise with air flow since they can't include a center forehead intake. The extractor vents try to make it as effective as the old one, but fall just a little short. Air fit system in awesome, the old 700 was always too tight on my cheecks, even after years of break in. This one fit perfect, slide it on, give the pads two pumps, ride in comfort. As for safety, probably about the same impact and slide protection as the old one, but the emergency release pads are a great addition. That's the biggest thing I show off when asked about my new helmet!\n",

I went to the store here locally and tried on a bunch of brands and sizes and it wasn't long before I realized that this helmet is extremely comfortable and super soft inside compared to many others. You need a snug fit and the built in air pump lets you adjust that fit perfectly. To help you out with size....My head is 22.5 inches so I fall in the medium size helmet according to their size chart. What I found out is that most mediums in many brands fit my head too big so I think that these helmets run a bit on the bigger side. I went with a small and it fits perfectly. Love the sun visor and it even came with a carrying case. The look of the helmet is superb. I got many compliments already.

      "I bought this helmet to replace my HJC IS-17, which is a solid helmet for the money, but it can't compete with the Scorpion EXO 1200 for comfort, style, and functionality. This helmet flows MUCH more air than the HJC, so on hot days it is comfortable—very comfortable, and the wicking fabric in the Scorpion is phenomenal.It is also aerodynamically superior, so no more buffeting around at higher speeds. The sun shield is manual instead of spring loaded, and I find that to be superior to the HJC's system that never fully retracted without a little push. With the Scorpion, you flip a lever up or down, and it never fails.The helmet is loud, so be prepared to wear earplugs if you are traveling any distance that takes more than a few minutes at higher speeds. I wear earplugs anyway, so this doesn't really bother me, and besides, this inconvenience is more than offset by the fact that this helmet looks very sexy. I mean it's bad-a** even if you aren't.My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a pinlock ready shield. The HJC did, and it worked beautifully at fighting the fogging.BTW—the high-vis yellow as depicted in the picture is not representative of the true color—the typical Scorpion grellow, which I prefer over the mellow yellow in the pic.\n",

      "This helmet is fantastic. I purchased this helmet to replace my 7 year old Shoei RF1100. After doing some research on the old interweb I found that the scorpion offered a lot for the money. I checked with a couple of dealers in my area and ordered one, as they didn’t have exactly what I wanted.When I picked up the helmet I was immediately impressed by the level of detail and refinement. The liner is smooth and different textures. The guys in the shop geeked out for a minute as it was the first time they had a EXO-T1200 in the store. They immediately grabbed the helmet and took it to the scales. They compared the weight to a RF1200 and concluded that it only weighed a couple of more ounces.The liner wicks away sweat very well even on 100 degree days. The visors (both of them work very well). The ventilation is top notch and it also comes with a really nice helmet bag. If they offered this helmet bag for sale I would buy it by itself.It appears to me that the EXO-T1200 is a higher quality product than the Shoei RF1200 at a lower price. Save yourself a couple hundred bucks and you will end up with a higher quality helmet.\n",

I wish it came down just a little further or didn’t have such a defined nose cut out. The way it fits me tends to create a large gap between my nose and the visor.  I find this a bit distracting as I have a nice tinted view but an exceptionally bright spot above my nose. I started looking at the visors on friends helmets and noticed that their cut outs were not as pronouncedAnd did not allow as much light to come through that area. Overall I like the helmet and I’m happy with the purchase. It is likely that down the line I will find an alternative that allows me better use of a drop-down visor.\n",

On January 19th, I was involved in my very first motorcycle collision. I was hit from behind by a fellow rider in our group. The collision caused me to fall backwards to the pavement. The impact was powerful and instant. I was so impressed with the design of this half helmet. It saved me from injury as designed. The insurance will pay for another one. No doubt, I'm getting the exact same helmet. I walked away from the accident and I have this helmet to thank!! 5 star rating!! *****\n",

      "This is my first LS2 helmet purchase and I'm very impressed.  Very comfortable and I really dig the thinner profile which significantly eliminates the big bobble head look common with most traditionally designed helmets.  While I prefer the traditional  double D ring chin strap over the quick release on this helmet it's not a deal breaker by any means.  I like the visor a lot but quickly discovered that I prefer wearing my clear lens riding glasses (Bilt S2's) in conjunction with the visor, especially around 50 MPH and above due to air circulation up under the visor.  One thing about sizing on this helmet:  If you are within 3/8\" or even a 1/2\" inch from the maximum circumference on the size chart, consider moving up to the next size.

      "This is my first half helmet so I'm not comparing my experience with any other half-helmets.  I purchased a medium based on previous reviews stating they run large.  I'm normally a large but the MD turned out to fit just right. My head is measured 58-59cm. It's well padded and comfortable.  It's not too large in size or weight in my opinion.  I haven't used the ear insets, so I can't attest to their noise blocking, but since I wear ear plugs, any advantage they provide wouldn't make much of a difference for me  The black chrome finish is beautiful but gets marred quite easily (no exaggeration). On speeds above 40mph I have noticed the helmet has a tendency to lift which I've read is common with half-helmets in general.  It's not too bad, and can be corrected if you tighten the strap, but that might cause you to choke yourself slightly.  It has great airflow, although I haven't played with the vent to test if it actually works when opened or closed.  The visor does a great job of not allowing light to penetrate when used, and there seems to be enough space for me to wear moderate sized glasses.  Overall I think this was a good purchase, and if I had to do so again I would have just purchased a different finish.\n",

      "I really wanted to love this helmet but it's just not happening.Some of it is LS2's fault, some of it mine.It took four tries.  First one XL, the visor broke out of the box.  I did try it on and it felt a bit loose, so I exchanged it for a L.This one was in perfect new shape.After 2 months of wearing it around the house to break it in (it has been a long winter) it was just not loosening up and I was getting major forehead hot spots. Tried another XL which came with another broken visor and the styrofoam not glued in,The fourth one came intact, but the visor is rattling.LS2--the visor on this helmet HAS to be reengineered. It's not LS2's fault my noggin is exactly between a L and XL, but that's where we stand. It rides up pretty hard at 50+ mph.The drop down visor isn't bad, but it isn't great either. If the nose cut or upside down 'V' were a little less pronounced, it would be better. It does come into my field of vision just a bit.The straps are good, but if you use the LinkIn Ride Pal, things get bulky very quickly.  Also, noise is a problem with the Ride Pal, but it's a half helmet. You're going to get wind in your face.Most everything negative about the helmet I would be able to overlook if it just fit my head better.I'll keep it around for back-up purposes, but I really don't see it getting much use.I really wish LS2 would combine the look and style of the Rebellion with the Bobber--kind of like a Shoe RJ Platinum.

      "I bought this helmet for warmer weather riding in Michigan and as a replacement for a full face helmet.  I like the fit and it is true to LS2's scale.  Fit is good and quality is very good.  Air flow is good around ears.  I do not feel any difference in airflow with the top vent open or closed.  wise level is OK at lower speeds.  Higher speeds brings more windnoise. It will all depend on your bike and windshield.  I have a 2000 Harley Ultra Classic with a short windshield.  I just bought a factory height shield and the wind noise is better.  I do ride with ear plugs now more from the exhaust noise than windnoise.  Weight is good.  Does not feel heavy.  In hot weather so far in Michigan (90's) the helmet is cool when riding and not noticeable in standing traffic.  I have ridden a few times in sub 50 degree weather and it is not cold.  My ears stay warm.  Face is cold but that is expected with open face helmet design.  I have also have the Sena SPMH-10FM attached to this helmet (see my other review on the Sena).  I can hear the Sena very well but with ear plugs that cut out the wind noise buffeting sound the Sena sound and clarity is even better.  The integral sun visor did not fit my normal glasses as other review stated they may not.  I have a pair of tight fitting sunglasses that clear the shield.  I use the shield more for direct sun riding as it provide more protection when used with my sun glasses.  Otherwise it is not very functional.  The looks of the helmet are good and I do not seems to have the bubble head look as with other helmets.  Great product and great price here on Revzilla.  I gave it a 4 overall for the function of the integral sun visor and the seeming lack of airflow through the top vent.\n",

      "I just received my LS2 rebellion yesterday and went for a 50 mile ride after work in 98 degree heat, and I'm really impressed.  The airflow and wind noise are noticeably better than my other half helmet (GMax).  I could easily hear my radio at 70+ mph.  I bought the clear wind screen for night riding, and was amazed at how clear it is.  It was literally like there was nothing there, and it did a good enough job of keeping out the wind that I didn't wear my riding glasses.  Replacing the stock wind screen with the clear was a slight challenge, but I found a YouTube video that showed how it's done.  Instructions would've been nice, but no big deal.  I'll only need my full helmet for the coldest winter days, which are seldom in the south.\n",

I'm a big fan of quick latch straps, but the one on this helmet does not operate smoothly and this is by far the worst one I have had.  The fit was very large!! I normally wear XL, and according to the size chart I should have been wearing XL as well, but I had to drop down to a L  for it to fit right.  for being vented I also expected more airflow, but I think that's in part due to the design without any venture exhaust ports on the back.  I feel it would greatly benefit if it had some.  Otherwise it was mostly average...It's a half helmet, it'll have limited protection like the rest of the half helmets.  I think the price point should be about $20-$30 less than what it is.\n",

      "Just complete a little over 100 miles in the LS2 Rebellion (Chrome Finish).  The helmet looks very sharp, and rides solid as a rock at highway speed (75+ MPH).  The visor works well and, while it will fit over my glasses, the clearance is very close.   Airflow through the vent system is good.   My only negative comment concerns the liner.  I wear a size XL.  My helmet shipped with a XXL liner installed, and I was required to remove that liner and install the supplied XL liner (XL and XXL helmets share the same shell).  Installation of the XL liner was a little tedious, and required more effort than I would have thought.  This was due to getting the snaps to line up properly.  However, once the liner was in place everything worked great.The helmet does fit slightly large on my head compared to my other XL size lids (Schuberth, Bell, and Scorpion), but it is not enough to affect the way the Rebellion looks or rides.  Overall an excellent choice.\n",

      "I'm prefacing this review: I'm a loyal LS2 guy. This is my third LS2 helmet. I've liked every one. I ride a lot and change out helmets about once every two or three years as soon as they get nicked up. This LS2 looks great (matte black) , fits great, and is priced right. One minor quibble,  I wish the hang over visor was removable. If I do go down I don't want the risk of plastic shards exploding  around my face.  Also, honestly, I cannot tell the difference when the air port is open or closed. However, I always wear a cool skin beanie under my helmet. I cannot tell the difference with my face sheild helmet either. The aspect that sets this helmet apart for me is that it never lifts or tilts back at higher speeds. It seems more aerodynamic than most other helmets. Half helmets are pretty simple things. This one is no exception. It looks great and works well for me.\n",

      "There's no doubt that this helmet looks cool. It fits ok and is a thinner profile than many....and it's vented! It does not look like a mushroom or the great Kazoo. I read some other comments about it being damaged in delivery and found the same with mine. The little visor/peak on the front was broken. I am concerned about durability of the replacement one...if it breaks off in the box before anyone even touches it, how will it hold up. The drop down visor fits nice and tight to the face and would be great in a rain, but if you wear glasses, I can't see them fitting behind. The inner padding isn't bad, but the centre seam in the back is such that it digs into the base of your skull. This may change in time, that's my initial observation in trying it on out of the box. I haven't worn it out riding as I am planning in returning it due to the broken piece. It looks great, but I don't think it's the helmet for me  *****attention Canadian shoppers. While Revzilla does ship to us for $30.00 flat fee, we're hosed with duty at the border and UPS ends up charging a brokerage fee which it then taxed. All in, it cost me 60 bucks to ship a 120 dollar helmet. Not happy with that experience. To top it off...now I have to ship it back at my expense.\n",

This helmet is definitely much lighter, quieter, face shield is much thicker/ more robust, and overall build is good. I got both helmets in XS since I have a small head. The S shoei was just a bit too loose on me. The XS does pull my ear pretty badly when pulling it off but I've been more careful and it's starting to break in. Air flow is very good but on cooler days the shield does fog very quickly when standing still. It comes with a pin lock but I usually use the tinted visor. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. If you're looking for a premium helmet and have the money, I would recommend it. That being said it is pricey but if I ever need to use it in earnest I'll be glad I spent the extra cash.\n",

      "From day one I was unable to get this visor to shut all the way.  The bottom right was not making contact with the bead.  I tried to adjust how hard the base pulled the visor back onto the bead to no avail. I finally called Shoei only to have my questions answered in a very snide and condescending matter.  Every question I asked, left me feeling more and more unqualified to own or have anything to do with this God’s gift to the motorcycle industry. After hanging up and feeling rather defeated I began an even more in-depth evaluation of the problem. I finally noticed that the base units were completely out of line with each other. I removed the visor and loosened the two Phillip’s screws on the right side.  I then used my calipers and set it exactly like the left, put the visor back on and boom, works like it should have out of the box.I am so completely unimpressed with Shoei’s customer service, not only did the rep have zip in the people person department, he had little to no insight.   I’ll be purchasing another helmet soon for a relative and it will not be a shoei. Maybe I should have just contacted Revzilla from the git go but I didn’t want to make Shoei’s problem their problem. I’m sure they would have been much more professional.\n",

      "Comfortable, but loud\n",
      "Got this (RF-1200, Recounter) to replace my 5yr old GT-AIR.  While I expected louder, I was surprised by how much louder it is considering how much better it fits than the longer oval that is the GT-Air (comparatively speaking).  Head turns result in a great deal of noise and a little stream of air that hits right behind my ears (weird).  No significant difference in noise or airflow to me in 3/4 or 'tuck' position on my MG GRiSO. Comfort otherwise is awesome and I feel much more secure with the better fit.  Speaker pockets are a little too small for Sena SMH10R speakers, but I've made do.Air flow is good above 50mph, but visor is cracked open at anything lower than 40mph.Visor actuation is smooth and light compared to the GT-Air that required some technique to click it closed.One nit, the comfort padding along the straps feels like cheap foam compared to the GT-Air.  Though I do not tug on them, just holding it out of the way while pulling on the helmet I worry about tearing them.\n",

It’s a pretty quiet helmet up to about 55 mph which I think is the norm. I added the Sena SMH-5 dual pack for my pillion partner and I and the fitment is the only issue I have. The premade speaker pockets are too small/tapered for the speakers so I had to use the foam pads which puts the speakers right up against my ears. Overall I love the helmet and really like the design of the Recounter with the red stripe. I’ve gotten so many compliments on the look! Totally worth the extra money for the graphic.\n",

      "I love this helmet, the RF1200 is the best fitting helmet I've ever tried on, included pinlock great for those cold mornings here in Utah to keep from fogging, feels a lot lighter and quieter than my old RF1000, still same fit/sizing. Size large in RF1000 and also in RF1200.I regularly also wear a Bell Bullitt (retro-modern, no frills, no tech) for the classic looks/style on my ThruxtonR, but Bullitt is nowhere near as comfortable, secure-fitting, aerodynamic or quiet as the RF1200. That should be no surprise, but wanted to provide a little comparison in case someone's looking. The Bullitt flows a TON of air, some through the always-open vent-holes but mostly just up from the chin area, which is great when it's hot, but sucks when it's cold or really sandy/dirty out as I find myself blinking to keep crap out of my eyes. The RF1200 has zero of these problems.I feel fully safe from the elements in the RF1200 and the air it DOES flow seems to flow correctly, in smartly placed areas to keep your face from sweating and screen from fogging. You can tell air is flowing, but is never sending air/dirt straight into your eyes.I will say that with my Bullitt I'm used to often keeping the face-shield slightly cracked just for a little more air flow, which works great because the face shield is so tall on the Bullitt, but at-speed (40 mph+) I can't leave the face shield of RF1200 cracked just slightly open otherwise you DO get air flowing straight to your eyes, but at speed I typically want it with the visor closed the pinlock keeps from getting fogged anyway, I am probably only cracking it out of habit from wearing the Bullitt.I regularly ride with ear-plugs in, but noticed the RF1200 by far more quiet than the Bullitt and even my old RF1000, I feel like I almost don't need the ear-plugs but continue to use them anyway to keep down on semi-truck/road-noise on my highway commutes.The only reason I'd wear any other helmet (my Bullitt) is purely for old-classic looks when I don't want the look for a racey/sporty/modern helmet. When I want the real protection, features, comfort for legit riding, there's no helmet I'd rather have than the RF1200. A+++\n",

      "I ordered the Recounter in black blue red.  The graphic is really nice folks.  It's definitely a BMW aimed scheme but I don't care.  Looks sick and my Tuono is black and red anyway.  I've worn a Corsair V till my recent wreck and this helmet is a bit more long oval than that intermediate oval shape.  It's not Signet X long but ....  Compared to the old RF1100 I have, no comparison.  It's smaller shelled, lighter, and better looking.  At least as comfortable.  I'm really happy with it.  The Corsair was fine at the track but not great on the the road.  But that makes sense if you know the design brief.  Money well spent.  Cheers.\n",

This was too tight so i purchased large cheek pads and it fit well after it broke in. These new cheek pads did not make the helmet move on my head when i did a shake test.  I also got the chin curtain to reduce noise because it is a little loud over 55 mph without it. As i said i crashed wearing this helmet on the track. I low sided around 90 mph mid corner. I don't believe i hit my head super hard however i did sustain a concussion. I think i hit my head when i went off the road on the edge of the track.  It did its job and was very affordable because of this i purchased a second one, but in a large size.\n",

I would rather not put on a stinky helmet and prefer to let them air out over 8 weeks.  The fit is perfect for my box shaped head and they flow generous amounts of air and I like how the visor securely closes and how easy the latch is to operate with gloves on.  They are pretty good aerodynamically with minimum torque when you turn your head side to side.  They also fit my Sena bluetooth very easy and have deep enough recesses for the earpieces.  Cons:  Ok I only have one gripe about my FG-17 it is loud at highway speeds and ear protection should be worn or hearing loss will come.\n",

The visor on the HJC feels much thicker and positive in it's positions.  It also didn't fog up as quickly as the AGV.  The first notch will open the visor just a crack to keep you safe and ventilated.  The AGV wins in airflow however.  I would always ride with the visor cracked one notch.  I felt it was too stuffy with the visor locked shut.  I purchased the AGV because it was available at a cyclegear store.

It does a great job keeping the wind noise down, looks great, and it is snell approved.  One thing is that this helmet does not come with a visor, so you can use the extra money you saved by buying one.  If you wear glasses, getting them in may be a hassle, but you can bend the side foam to give you a little extra room to fit.  The only thing I can think of is the air flow is not the greatest, however it can keep you cool on a 90+ degree day.  Also I came here after the bell qualifier.

      "It's a great helmet for the money.  DOT and Snell rated in this price range is fantastic.  Helmet looks great and does it's job protecting your noggin.  That said it doesn't come without some negatives.  Very tight fit.  According to the sizing chart I was right at the top of the XL scale so to be on the safe side I ordered a XXL.  Well, it was still way too tight and I really had trouble even putting it on.  Taking it off was total torture.  If you have a narrow face you should be fine but if you have strong cheek bones or your head is more round than oval you will have issues with this helmet.  I ordered the 3 XL cheek pads and am hoping that they will fit better than the 2 XL currently in the helmet.  Also since it is Pinhole insert ready it really should come with a pinhole type shield.  I know HJC wants to save money on this helmet but the difference would have been marginal at best and wouldn't effect the price that much.  So why cheap out on the shield and make you spend additional money on what should have been included in the first place.\n",

      "Great helmet for the price\n",
      "Was between a handful of helmets, and concluded on this one mainly because I found a closeout design that knocked a substantial amount off the price (would highly recommend going that route). So as far as the good goes: The helmet breaks in nicely, the vents work well, it's fiberglass, so it's good protection and it's light enough that it doesn't leave my neck craned at the end of a ride. It's good looking, the visor is easy to remove, I presume it's aerodynamic (unless you're behind an 18-wheeler!) and the pinlock readiness is a very nice feature. The bad: It doesn't come with a chin curtain, and you'll need one to keep wind from blasting through, the regular visor without the pinlock won't stay fog-free, so you'll need one before riding, the wind noise is a little bit much at a certain speed, but the chin curtain helps. This helmet's cheek pads are also pretty big, I've contemplated buying a new pair to swap them out with. A minor thing: it's doesn't have as many vents as you may want, just two on the top and one at the chin. Lastly, it doesn't have cutouts for speakers like a few similar helmets that this price-point have, Bottom line: I'd recommend this helmet, especially if you get it with an older design on a closeout deal, but it's important to keep in mind that you're looking about about $35-65 bucks in extras if you want it to perform at it's peak (pinlock visor, chin curtain, possibly new cheek pads and other add-ons)\n",

      "This helmet has been fantastic. I'm a daily rider in Boston and have used this for 3k miles. I have 2 other helmets but this blows them away- HJC 3/4 helmet and the Speed and Strength SS700 Dogs Of War.This is one of the safest helmets on the market and under $200. I find it truly comfortable and have done rides over 500 miles long straight through with no issues. The screen provides an excellent view. I bought a black smoke screen for summer riding and the helmet looks mean with that on, absolutely love it.The noise is pretty standard but I use foam plugs regardless of helmet which greatly enhances the ride. The foam is still in excellent condition and the helmet is yet to smell (I do use a bandana). The screen can fog in certain conditions as any helmet does but it is minimal and easily fixed by raising it slightly or putting in the pinlock lens insert.The matte black look is great, the helmet feels very secure/safe, and the features are solid. It is easy to change screens, the screen is easy to open up even with gloves, and the airflow is good.I certainly recommend this product to anyone, especially if you are on a budget but want the best in safety.\n",

      "So, Your looking for a full helm, we know that already. You want to go above and beyond the lousy DOT rating you want to be part of the SNELL club.Coming in at under $200 the FG-17 Packs a valuable punch, with its snell rating; Its comfortable, not overly loud, has a good locking visor, two brow vents, and a mouth vent. The DOT, and snell ratings on the back are stickers so you can opt to remove them if you don't live in a NAZl state. Almost all of the interior padding is removable for washing or even replacement, Pretty cool ehh? The visor is also removable and you can get a whole slew of different ones, I went with the smoked visor for under $20 that's a worthy investment.I opted for the Flat Black Option, what a BAD CHOICE. Trust me, If I could go back I would. One slip off your bikes seat going tumbling through a bob evens parking lot and you beautiful helmet will be scuffed for life (I never liked bob evens anyways). Even though the flat black helmet matches my Harley with \"Denim Black paint\" nearly perfectly, the upkeep for matte paint is more than I think most of us are willing to invest in a helmet (Not to mention the fingerprint magnet the matte paint is). I would like to see a magnet strap instead of a snap for something in the $200 price range, and after about 6 months of riding the padding is still comfortable as month 1.As to the safety of the helmet, well I haven't wrecked in it. So I can't really attest to how it holds up in a wreck. We're just going to have to trust SNELL on this one.\n",

      "I chose this helmet because of the HJC reputation, confirmation from Revzilla folks that's it's a good helmet for what I was looking for, the price point and the positive reviews.I can't speak for true safety because I haven't had it in a fall yet. I hope I never do. But it is also SNELL approved as well as DOT (of course).I am right in the middle of two sizes so I sized down (small). I'm glad I did because I think the size up would've given too much wiggle room. I wanted a snug comfortable safe fit. This \"fit\" the bill. It's snug and when I first wore it for a full weekend (5 hrs at a time, in the rain both days) it had a hot spot by my ear. I've worn it numerous times since and that spot no longer exists.I don't find an issue with venting or the weight. I've ridden it in 85+ degree temps in the summer with no heat issues at all. I crack the shield open a tiny bit when at 45 or lower speeds to increase airflow (sometimes nice just to feel the breeze). When I was in the rain, the visor did fog up. But I think something to reduce fog if riding in the rain might be good to have.I'm having difficulty finding sunglasses to fit that don't pop up onto the ridge of my brow due to the padding and making the glasses uncomfortable. I'm not willing to adjust the great padding just for glasses so a tinted visor or screen might be next on my search to deal with sun glare. I haven't had to switch out the visor yet so I can't speak to the ease of doing that at this time. Visibility is good.At high speeds (70mph+) there is a bit of noise (sans windshield). Nothing major but I'm sure on really long drives it won't be good for your hearing/noggin.I opted for the silver for cager visibility and well, I just like it. :) I prefer to be seen so I can ride another day.I really like this helmet and would suggest it to the average rider with average sized/shaped noggin.PS: I can't wear earrings with it. It's too snug and will just pull too hard when taking it on/off. In photo also from Revzilla: Jacket (AGV Sport Women's Lotus Leather Jacket); Gloves in my hand (Joe Rocket Women's Cleo Gloves).\n",

Long story short I went with the HJC FG-17... I must say I've never come across a helmet in the $150 price range that is as well thought out and put together as this is. Like the Shoei, this helmet was clearly designed in a wind tunnel. Unlike the scorpion, I got almost no bug-splatters; for me that's the sign of a great helmet - it's proof that the wind is moving around your helmet, being redirected from your face. It's not too noisy, it's not too heavy, it fits great, very comfortable for long trips, great airflow. And for around $150 you just can't beat the price.\n",

One thing though, it is more of a round headshape, so people with more narrow heads will feel a little bit of pressure on their foreheads. That happened to me, but after breaking it in a little, it fits perfectly.\n",

      "Got this helmet as a starter helmet. Fit perfectly from the day I got it, even when wearing a balaclava.Loved the matte black style. Face shield fogged up too easy when temp got to mid 40s.Really durable material and saved my life when I was hit by a car who wasn't looking. Flew off my bike and frogsplashed the ground and scratched up the face shield pretty bad. No damage to the actual helmet but the shield stayed on and closed as I slid. It protected me more than a $600 helmet my friend wore in his accident where the visor broke off the helmet.Bang for the buck? You bet! Only thing I didn't like other than the shield fogging up in cold weather was there is no cloth chin guard on the inside. Wind will sweep up into the helmet and into your eyes on the freeway unless you wear extra protection like sunglasses. Had to tuck my neck more than once on a cold ride to keep my eyes protected. Had a rock or two get inside the helmet too to hit me in the chin/nose but I guess that's just bad luck.\n",

SNELL and better material at this price point? Awesome.Fitment: In terms of size, I am right smack in the middle of L and XL. After speaking with Revzilla Customer Service about it, I opted to go with the L to compensate for the foam breaking in. I'm glad I did because it fits perfectly now, it was very snug at first but after going out a few times it turned out fine. In terms of shape, this is for those with a rounder head and it fits me wonderfully (the Bell Vortex, which is designed for intermediate ovals, squeezed my temples really bad).Nit picking: Like Anthony said, I wish the detents were a tad stronger and the liner isn't the plushiest, but hey, it works and it's comfortable.I also bought the dark smoke face shield with a pinlock insert (only way to go for no fogging) and it's great. Also, for whatever reason, it says that it does not come with a pinlock insert...mine did, so I don't know what happened. Not complaining because it worked out (one for my clear shield and one for my tinted shield).All in all, if you're on somewhat of a budget and looking for a great helmet with top tier protection, look no further!\n",

I measured my head and started out trying a small (I fell squarely into the \"small\" size range), but found the helmet to be a little big when it arrived. My head wasn't rattling around in it, but after doing a bit more research on how a helmet should fit I found that if you turned the helmet side to side on your head, your skin should move with it, but there shouldn't be painful pressure points. I reordered in an XS and it fits perfectly. I was glad as a girl, that I was able to fit into a helmet that wasn't \"girly\" looking. Revzilla made the return very easy.\n",

He was dumbfounded at the quality and features of the sample FG-17 helmet he had seen.Low and behold, 1 year later, I'm looking for another helmet - this time for my unfaired Triumph Speed Triple. The second I slipped this baby on, I was sold. The fit and finish are on par with helmets twice the price. I was impressed with the materials chosen overall. From the liner to the vents to the shell...this helmet is a steal. The visor hardware is simple, uncomplicated and works every time. The helmet feels super light. I was amazed at how quiet it was at highway cruising speeds without a windscreen. I can hear myself talk without ear plugs in. I like the look of the white with the dark smoke visor.I took this helmet on a 6,500 mile road trip without a windshield, and I am still impressed. I hope HJC continues making these in 3 years when I will be looking to replace this one.Pros:QualityWeightQuietLooksMinor Gripes:There is a slight whistling from the center latch, but only at very high speeds.The strap could be a little longer, and the pull tab sometimes gets in the way when threading through the d-rings.Wish List:A photo-chromatic option would be nice to eliminate the need to carry two shields.I wish the HJC logo were a decal or painted on, it is a PITA to pick bugs out of it.\n",

My biggest criticism is that if I am riding with the shield up and hit a bump the shield often drops down. Not a big deal but still annoying. I would like a helmet that is a lighter, but am not willing to spend that kind of money at this point. The helmet comes with an HJC logo on the front. I thought it was a permanent feature but was happy to find it peeled off with almost no effort or residue (if HJC would like to sponsor me, I will gladly ride around with their logo proudly displayed).\n"

      "I bought the FG-17 as a summer helmet. It hasn't gotten really hot yet, but it's gotten warm and so far my head hasn't been the sweaty mess I expected. The solid white color (I'm glad this colorway is even available) reflects rather than traps heat, and is noticeably cooler than my black helmet. The venting also seems pretty good, and as this helmet has nothing blocking the air under the chin, I'm happy to trade the extra cooling for a little wind noise.The faceshield feels nice and substantial and is reasonably antifog even without the inserts, and the ratcheting mechanism works fine for me. I don't have a problem keeping it locked in the position I want, and it's easy to move quickly to where I want while riding. I have a good field of view and optical clarity. The latch is also nice to have, and easy to use.The faceshield, when open, doesn't go up and back over the head as far as on some other helmets. The top of this helmet, with its vent structure, is built up somewhat. This issue doesn't substantially obstruct my vision, and might even make for a nice little rain shield (or sun visor, if your faceshield is tinted -- mine's clear).The liner seems pretty decent so far. I haven't tried to clean it yet, but it's also nice that even though I've been riding on warm (not yet hot) days I haven't felt the need to, either. The vinyl on the bottom rolls far enough in that when I set the helmet down, the liner fabric doesn't get mussed, but the soft fabric rather than the vinyl is still what touches my neck.The fit is good and snug without being overly tight. The cheeks, as other reviewers have noted, are pretty snug, though. This hasn't been a problem for me at all, but could be for some riders. I haven't felt the need to compress the pads, though.Despite the fiberglass/Kevlar shell, I don't notice a significant weight savings over my polycarbonate helmet (I haven't made comparisons on the scale). The built-up top seems to give the helmet a somewhat high center of gravity, and this may be the reason my neck doesn't feel any less fatigued. I quickly got used to the center of gravity, though.I don't get much deflection from crosswinds or head turns, but most of the time in the city I'm not going super-fast.The breath deflector is pretty small and a little difficult to insert, but holds its place better than on some other helmets. But anyway, I don't use it so it doesn't matter to me.One gripe I have with this helmet is the chinstrap. Its placement is far enough back that it rubs uncomfortably on my neck if tight, so I have to leave it a little loose. But the bigger issue is that the closure is the old-fashioned double D-ring type (a built-in tab at least makes them easy to separate). This is good for security and reasonably good for adjustability in some ways, but for a street rider is a real pain in the butt for quickly removing the helmet or fastening/unfastening with gloves. I'd much prefer a quick-release, seatbelt buckle type of strap fastener that other helmets have, especially because I can't wear the strap tight anyway.A nice feature the chinstrap does have is a simple snap that allows the user to quickly hand the helmet from the motorcycle. I'm not sure about the snap's durability, though, and keep wondering whether one day my helmet is just going to drop to the ground next to my bike.Anyway, I like this helmet. It's SNELL rated, it's a good value considering the features it has vs. the price of other helmets, I'm glad I bought it and I would recommend it to others. I've also gotten some admiring remarks from other riders who've handled it.\n",

      "I like this helmet. It seems that HJC helmets run a bit on the tight side, so I got an XL and it's still plenty snug. The only thing I didn't like was how tight it was on my cheeks. Like, WAY snug. I don't have a particularly fat face, but it really pushed on my cheek bones in such a way that I almost had to drop my jaw and keep my mouth open. So, with my mouth open, when I would close it, it was like my cheeks were pushed into my teeth, causing me to almost bite the inside of my cheeks. As you can imagine, that isn't very comfortable. I'd find myself gritting my teeth so I wouldn't bit my cheek when I opened and closed my mouth.I solved the problem by clamping a couple of pieces of wood to the facial pads and leaving the clamps on for a couple of days. It seems to have compressed the foam enough that it's more comfortable now. They say helmets get loose as you wear them and that sometimes is the case, but not always. It's much more comfortable now (after wearing it for some time and clamping the foam face pads down for some weeks). So if you've got a \"puffy\" face or a wider head at the cheeks (above the mouth, below the eyes), or a \"strong\" jaw line, you may have a similar fit problem.I love the airflow, and how light this helmet is. I wish the chin strap was attached slightly more forward -- when tight, it digs into the neck rather than fit comfortably under the jaw. Small thing -- I leave the strap a bit looser and it's not a problem.No helmet is perfect. This one is a good value for the price.\n",

      "This is my first motorcycle helmet. I have an HJC AR-10 II which I use for HPDE's in my car. I was impressed with the AR-10, so I decided to give the FG a try. Ended up getting the matte black version. Unlike the photos, it doesn't come with a solid logo sticker above the visor. Instead, it has a 4 piece rubbery logo instead, which I removed in order to have a logo-less helmet. Despite everything that I have done, after removal of the rubber logo, you can still faintly see the shadow where the logo was. It's not that big of a deal, just an observation. I did end up buying the chin curtain for the helmet, which dramatically helped the amount of noise and wind entering the helmet at speed. There is a slight buzzing noise coming from the shield (I believe) when you turn your head at speed. I don't notice it with ear plugs in, but when I've gone plug-less, I've noticed it. Venting is good. Ended up adding an light smoke shield, which is plenty dark for me. The shield doesn't really stay up unless you lift it all the way up. Not sure if most motorcycle helmets are this way, because my AR-10 II isn't like this. On that one, I can leave the shield open halfway, and it doesn't move at all. If I open this one halfway, and nod my head, it will shut. Not a huge issue, since it's always closed when riding. But that might be something to look at if you like to keep it open. Overall, I'm pleased with it, and would recommend it.\n",

You also want comfortable, reliable with some nice features. Well again this product has it. For the money this has quite a bit. It has 3 main vents for air (2 top and 1 mouth), it has a nice sleek design made to be comfortable and not super heavy because of the materials it is made from (fiberglass composite), BUT in my opinion the nicest feature of this helmet is the locking system for the face shield and the pins for the 2nd attachable shield to stop your shield from fogging up (and yes it actually works very well). The locking system is nice because it makes pretty much a full air locking system to cut down on noise and the pins are great because who likes foggy shields!??!? NO ONE! again this helmet is the bang for the buck pick for what you get. I have the flat black and it is very easy to clean and I have not have had any problems with using cleaners and keeping it Matte looking (it still looks matte and the cleaners do not give it any sort of glass look what so ever) Great choice people!

I have no replaced the helmet yet and have covered up the scratch with a Alpinestars sticker.Style - It is a pretty basic looking black full face. I have the gold mirror lens and it looks phenomenal. I've gotten lots of compliments.Comfort - I can ride with this thing on all day without any issue. I ride a 2011 Kawasaki ZX-6R which is a pretty aggressive riding position. When on the highway I have to look up most of the time and the helmet is not heavy at all. I feel no strain on my neck after a long ride.Protection - Like I said, I highsided at 40mph. Protected my head but my head was also not the one that came into contact with the road the most...my knee and elbow was.Air Flow - Has plenty of flow when you want, and you can block it off when you don't want it. I have yet to learn how to use the vents at the top. I use an Alpinestars Touring Winter Balaclava in the winter and nothing in the summer. I have had no issues in either season.Features - Removable liner, vents up top, vent near mouth, pinlock lens, quick release lens system, and locking lens. These are all fantastic features. Lens doesn't fog, and I like how it locks along the gasket.Noise - I usually have headphones in so I don't notice. Even when I don't use headphones I don't notice the wind all that much...I guess I'm just used to it?Weight - I can ride with this thing on all day without any issue.

Maybe something about the air flow around the helmet.The shield is very clear, almost as though there is no shield.I have to put the helmet on and then put on my glasses/sunglasses. I cant find any way to keep them on and put on or remove the helmet.Since it's been fairly cool, I haven't had much need for the vents but in just experimenting with them, I don't see much difference with them open or closed. I may get more feel for that when warm weather returns.Overall, this helmet is very comfortable with good visibilty. I think it is a very good value for the money and would recommend it.A word on Revzilla service - outstanding, awesome, unparalleled - are a few words that come to mind. I spoke with several different reps, they were all very patient and professional. Revzilla even picked up the shipping on the helmets that were unsatisfactory. I rate them five stars on a five star scale! I will definitely be a returning customer.\n",

      "This is the first helmet I every bought, my others where hand-me-downs. Therefore, I'm not exactly a pro at reviewing them. However, I can say that the helmet seems to have all of the features as a much more expensive helmet (the sales guy at the showroom, Bobby, compared it to a $400 or $500 Shoei).I have a more oblong head, so it feels tight on my forehead, but I won't blame that on the helmet. Also, I'm more of a plain guy, so I don't really like the look of the vents and the little spoiler on the back, but I have to say, they all function very well. For my first helmet initially wanted something that fit my style more, but I ended up with a much more functional, and affordable helmet. I run hot, and it seems to have good airflow, and the anti-fogging lens is amazing.To begin with I was only looking for a helmet with the standard DOT rating, but its nice that the helmet's Snell approved. Sadly it seems that the money I saved on the helmet may be lost, because it looks like if I want a different visor, I may need to buy a anti-fog lens for it, meaning a new visor (+ anti-fog lens) may be something like $70. Nevertheless, its a great helmet for a beginner like myself specifically because it is affordable, it has the anti-fog lens, and its Snell approved.\n",

      "I bought this helmet to replace my exo700 which was snell 2005, and I wanted a snell 2010.First off, the only part where this helmet loses to my exo is that it isn't as comfortable as my. The helmet fits a bit more snug, which is much better for safety, but the breath guard always hits my nose when I look up and it's just not as comfortable to wear.Now for the good parts! The helmet looks good (in my opinion) and the airflow is GREAT. The first time I rode with it I actually thought something was wrong because I was getting so much airflow.The anti fog system is the best I've ever seen. I've actually tried to make it fog up a few times, and it was impossible. I've ridden in the rain with it and it was always great. The ONLY time I've ever had it fog up was when I was in stopped traffic, in a torrential downpour, with the steam from the engine and radiator going directly into my helmet. As soon as I got above 5 km/h the visor instantly cleared. I wish all helmets came with its anti-fog system.One of the drawbacks is that when you're in full tuck and look up, the view is a little obscured by the top of the helmet, right above the visor. I'm guessing this helmet is designed more for fzs or er6ns or other, more upright seated bikes. With that said, you can still see, but the field of vision could definitely be improved.I really like my helmet, and I absolutely love the anti-fog shield insert. For the price, it's pretty unbeatable. DOT and SNELL approved as well, so it will be valid on any road or race track in North America.\n",

And, I would prefer a quick release strap, but that may not be allowed for the Snell rating. The fit is relatively narrow.

The shield and the included pinlock are both outstanding. Vision is excellent, and it has yet to fog on me in our humid GA weather. Air flow is hard for me to rate because it has been a very mild august, and as such, it has not been extremely hot.Cons: The cons are not deal breakers at all in my book. First of all, the shield is great and the locking mechanism is wonderful, but the detents to hold it in any position other than full open are too weak to keep it there. Also, at full open this helmet requires a tuck position to keep it from experiencing lift from the oncoming air.\n",

      "HJC gives a lot of bang for the buck. I was torn between the AGV K4 Evo and this one. I ended up choosing this one because of the visor lock. My last helmet, which was also an HJC, popped open on the highway when I did head turns, so I knew with this years helmet I wanted that resolved. The lock is great, and because it's centered on the visor, I can use either hand to pop open the lid.Size wise I would say it's identical to Shoei. And by identical, I really think the fit is identical. Scorpions, Icons, Arais and Bells are really tight on my head in Smalls, but Mediums I can turn them almost 90 degrees. The only helmets I've found that fit snug but not too constricting are Shoeis and HJCs.The breath deflector does it's job and the pin-lock, while I don't choose to use it, I hear does great in cool weather. I'm the type of guy that doesn't like the logo look on the helmets, so an upside to HJCs are that they use stickers, not decals under clearcoat. Though, when I did remove the stickers, it did take a bit of the finish off (i will use a hair dryer next time instead of peeling them off with my finger nails).All in all, this helmet has the feel and fit of a $500+ helmet. For only $179, it was a steal.\n",

      "Bang for the buck- Shoei is an expensive helmet but has all of the features one needs for true dual sport riding and gives you real piece of mind with its safety features.Protection and Durability- After a freak mid-speed (30-40MPH) impact with livestock on a national forest hard-packed road; I landed on my head and shoulder (I was standing on the pegs at the time); but even though I was temporarily knocked unconscious, I didn't suffer a concussion or have any subsequent cognitive issues. The outer shell was gouged/scratched and some helmet accessories were damaged/destroyed but the helmet worked as designed.Features- The peak is relatively quite and stable at speeds under 80 MPH and works great on sunny days. The DS design allows plenty of breathing room when exerting yourself in hot, technical off-road situations. A quick squirt of Muc-off keeps fogging at bay in all-day rainy weather when using the vents correctly.Comfort/Airflow- The helmet is a bit heavy but well balanced so I have had no issue with neck discomfort; neither on multi-week tours nor days of demanding more technical riding. I had some pressure points early but replaced my head pad (available on Shoei's website) with the thinner version and all was good. The helmet can be a bit warm with visor shut on 80+ degree days even with all vents open...goggles (they fit the helmet well) solve that problem off-road.Style- The external helmet dimensions are specific to sizes so the smaller sizes are well proportioned but in solid white they look like a storm trooper- if buying again I'd get a darker solid or the Navigate style. Overall a rock solid, safe helmet for DS if you will be riding on and off-road.\n",

      "A big step up from Shoei Qwest\n",
      "I was shopping online for a replacement helmet and chose this over the Arai XD4 for its look on Revzilla video and the pinlock lens inclusion. This review is based on my experience having owned an HJC CS-R3, Shoei Qwest and now my new Shoei Hornet X2. First off, I am Chinese American with a big asian melon which I thought was more round, so I went with the Shoei Qwest size XL for its shape. Turns out the immediate oval Hornet size XL fits quite nicely, it feels more snug but not tight, and cradles my jaw line better with what seems to be beefier cheek pads. It feels more comfortable than my Qwest overall and I am sure will be even more so after the break-in period. Being a dual sport helmet, it offers more real estate in the frontal area which is great as I always felt like my lips are almost brushing up against my bluetooth microphone with my Qwest. The field of vision is excellent! I can see a lot more now especially during lane change. Interestingly, riding at 45mph with my visor up, the wind does not hit my eyes full on like my Qwest does, nor does the turbulent create the slight \"whistle\" I am getting with the Qwest. The most welcoming change is the peak. It blocks out any sunlight coming straight down from above and I no longer get eye strain from the irritable reflection from within the visor. You may not realize this until you hold a book over your visor out on a high noon to notice the difference! Another plus is the peak acts as a buffer to prevent the helmet from rolling over itself while sitting sideway and scratching the visor. This has happened to me more often than not and I had already purchased two replacement visors for my Qwest as the result. When shut, the visor does fog up very easily, so a pinlock lens is a must and I am glad it comes with the helmet. Now comes to riding experience. I have a scale. The Qwest XL weighs 3lb13oz while the Hornet XL weighs 4lb2oz. I swear the Hornet feels lighter in my hands, and on my head static or riding. This may due to the better fit and overall balance of the Hornet anyway I am pleased. Up to 70mph, the Hornet feels stable and the peak remains aerodynamic during head turns. Anywhere up to 85mph(so far I have tried) it does make my head wobble like an Indian nod (no offense here for lack of a better description), but by all means not intolerable. To be fair, my Qwest does that too just not as pronounced. Noise-wise, the Hornet is noticeably quieter than my Qwest at any speed so far visor up or down. Overall, the Hornet is definitely more comfortable and without a doubt a nicer helmet of the two. this is a nice upgrade for me and looks good with my Honda NC700X. If I could only wish I had skipped out on the Qwest and gone straight to the Hornet. I highly recommend this helmet.\n",

      "My Best Helmet So Far\n",
      "I was looking at different helmets to replace my existing LS2 modular helmet, and was choosing between the Hornet X2 and the Arai XD4. I was leaning towards the Hornet from the start because I felt that the peak was much more forgiving at higher speeds. I fitted the helmet at the store and when I got it on, I immediately knew I had to get the Shoei. It felt like the helmet was built around my head. The ventilation is great when there is no chin curtain, and it's decent with the chin curtain installed. It's quiet at highway speeds, though I do ride my Versys with my windshield all the way up. I also always ride with earplugs, if anyone's asking. Shoulder checks did not give me any problems, even with the peak installed. It's perfectly balanced, and riding for hours on end has not given me any neck aches or pressure points. The field of vision on this thing is amazing! At times, I forget that I'm wearing a helmet! The visor lens is also optically correct and so clear that you also tend to forget that it's there. My best helmet ever!\n",

I have not regretted it once.I was between a med and large from the size chart went with the large fits like a glove. Have used it everywhere from the highway to single track woods riding. On the road it really shines. Quiet as any street helmet I have owned and never catches wind even at 90mph.From reading other reviews I was worried that it was going to suck off road. Not the case. Wore it for 3 days of trail/woods riding in 90 degree weather. Sure the airflow could have been a little better in the tight stuff but not once did it bother me to the point of wanting to ditch it.This helmet is just down right comfortable. Yes it is expensive but you get what you pay for.If you are looking for a duel sport helmet just bite the bullet and buy it. You will not regret it!\n",

      "Quality, Quality, Quality\n",
      "I originally bought a Bell MX-9 ADV helmet because it was such a good price here on Revzilla. The fit was horrible for me and honestly, even for the cheap price, it felt a little chintzy. I returned and spent extra for what I really wanted in the first place, this X-2. When I pulled it out of the box, I immediately knew I have made the right decision. The difference in overall quality is astounding. The fit was perfect but then I knew it would be from owning several Shoeis before. On my first ride (and only so far) with the helmet, I noticed quite a bit of air coming under the chin bar, as also happened on the Bell. I put it down to the nature of ADV helmets. The huge difference, aside from the aforementioned quality, was the virtually non-existent lift from the bill.  The bill on the Bell created a significant amount of lift and if I had ridden longer than 30 minutes, I'm sure my neck would've started hurting. On the Shoei however, the bill is heavily vented and there was virtually no lift until about 70 mph and even then it was negligible. The visor optics were outstanding, the vents and visor mechanism felt substantial and the lining was extremely comfortable.  Last night I found the extra bag with instructions and it contained a chin skirt which I promptly installed. That might mitigate the air coming under the chin bar problem.  It also came with a breath deflector which I also installed and I'm sure it will help on cold rides.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars all the way across was because, yes, it is pricey.\n",

      "First Shoei\n",
      "I had previously ordered an HJC DS-x1, but returned it due to a product flaw.  I kept it for a week or so, but it never really fit right, it's a little too round for my head, and I found that the chinstrap was too far back.  I never rode with it.  Never took the sticker or tags off.I ordered the Shoei basically because everyone raved about them and I was fed up with ill fitting helmets.  I got a white one because I live in Mississippi and it gets hot here in the summer.  It fit great right out of the box, and the strap was further forward.  As mentioned in the video, the ventilation leaves something to be desired, but it isn't bad.  I found that the chin guard vent could have flowed better, but a noticeable difference was felt when the top vent was opened.  On my test ride this afternoon, the peak is unnoticeable when your head is straight, but turn your head and it will catch wind.  For the choices I made in the review...a 3 out of 5 for bang for the buck.  I feel like the price was a little high for a helmet, but it is a very good helmet.  That may be me being cheap.a 5 out of 5 for Protection and Duability, Features, Comfort, and Style.  It is DOT and Snell rated, it looks to be a quality product with replacement parts available, it is very comfortable right out of the box, and I think it looks good.  I like low key stuff.  and I find that this fits the bill.Fit: True - I wear a large in most every helmet I've ever worn and my head measures at 23.5\"Shape - I would put this in between a long and intermediate oval base on the HJC and my last helmet, a Speed and Strength ss2200, both intermediate ovals.  Both had pressure points on the forehead.  This helmet has a much better fit all the way around my head.Weight - I guess it's average.  It's not overly heavy, but I think the HJC might have been lighter.Vision - the face shield is optically correct and has a high field of view.  I don't know how they could improve that.Noise level - it makes some noise, but not as much as my SS helmet.  I could ride with this one and not wear earplugs if I had to.  I've never ridden with a high quality full face helmet that would be very quiet, so take that for what it's worth. Air Flow - It's not bad.  as mentioned before the chin vent could be better.I hope this helps the next customer that is looking for a helmet.  The reports are true...  It is a great helmet.\n",

      "This is my second Shoei, the first was the Rf-1100 from 2013 used for my sportster with no windshield.  That helmet had a decent enough amount of airflow with the six top vents and the visor defog vent.I purchased the Hornet X-2 to go with my new Klr650.  With the factory windshield you really have to stick you head up in the wind to get the lense to clear.  But the good news is the pinlock Evo Lens works freakin great.  I ride year round and on my 48 degree ride this week I had zero condensation in my line of sight.  Yesterday after 2hrs of off-road riding and sopping wet helmet the lense was still clear on the ride home.About that sopping wet helmet.  The hornet did not have enough airflow to keep me dry.  We were riding in 60 degree low humidity, 80-90 % shade and average 15-30mph speeds.  Sadly, the helmet did not have much airflow and left my head and the padding soak with sweat.For a dual sport/purpose helmet I was hoping for more airflow at the low speeds I was riding in.  In the future I'll be taking a towel or two to dry out after riding and a balaclava for the ride home.  The insulation won't do you much good for the ride home if you wet and cold.I can make this helmet work I'll just have to plan accordingly.\n",

      "I've had this helmet since May 2016. I couldn't be happier with it. It very comfortable but does take some time to break in. Id estimate 15-20 hours probably. At first I had thought the cheek pads were too small. After some time they broke in and are much more comfortable now. I was right in between the sizes Medium and Large for my head circumference. I went with the medium and after the break in period it fit great. The pinlock feature is a huge benefit especially now that the weather is cooling off. The shield comes off in seconds but I am still able to wear googles with the shield attached. The chin curtain and breath guard are also great. Without the chin curtain the helmet is very breezy even with the shield down, which is great for the summer months. Ive ridden in temperatures from 38 F to 102 and the helmet has been bearable across the board. I couldn't be happier with the purchase and would recommend this helmet to any adventure rider. Just be sure to let the helmet break in before trying to swap out pads for larger or smaller ones.\n",

      "I've owned this helmet for a year and a half and it's my everyday lid. I've worn it on 1000+ mile road trips, 90mph freeway cruising, rain riding and offroading. My previous helmet was an Icon Variant and this is far better in every way, except maybe looks but this is still a great looking helmet especially in white, in my biased opinion. It's very aerodynamic under 65mph. Any extended highway riding over that speed and I take the peak off and any and all buffeting/pulling is gone. The peak removal/installation is 3 simple steps, takes 5 seconds if you're slow. Quite comfortable although the back edge of my ears get sore after a few hours of wearing it. Adjusting the helmet by shifting it slightly side to side seems to alleviate the issue temporarily. NOISY for the price. Ear plugs are a must. Maybe due to the shape of my head or width of neck, but I get drafts right behind my ears where the side neck pads meet the rear pads and this is the main cause of the major wind noise I believe. If you have a thicker neck or wear a balaclava this may not be a problemCould vent better for a dualsport/adv helmet. Fogs up easy if not moving or in cold conditions unless the pinlock is installed. The pinlock works amazing if installed properly, zero fogging issues even in cold rain/snow conditions. Head stays perfectly dry in pouring rain. The finish is not very durable, at least the white. Have gouges and scrapes through the paint from everyday wear and tear. My Icon helmets were more durable. All that being said I love this helmet and only have a few minor gripes, as listed above. If the helmet was $100 cheaper I think it would be well worth it. I'm looking for a more highway friendly quiet helmet for road trips now but will continue to happily wear this for everyday rides.\n",

Another feature that I LOVE are the crisp positive stops for the visor adjustment. It stays where you put it. The helmet is suprisingly quiet with the visor all the was closed.\n",

      "Exceeded My Expectations\n",
      "I just completed my first tour/adventure ride wearing this helmet. In brief, it met or exceeded my expectations with one exception.The tour was a mix of 1,300 miles of highway riding and 200 miles of off-road riding. The helmet was quieter than expected. The peak was not noticeable even at highway speeds and I felt no need to remove it.By way of comparison, my other helmets are Shoei including an RF 1100 (retired), a Neotech (occasionally used) and a GT Air (primary helmet).My primary reasons for purchasing this model were Shoei quality and fit, the ability to use goggles, the peak and a visor that need not be removed to use goggles.Shoei quality is evident throughout and the fit was comparable to my other helmets. Scott OTG goggles were recommended for this helmet but it was necessary to tip the chin of the helmet downwards to prevent the goggles from pinching my nose. This is my only nit to pick. It was very convenient to be able to switch between goggles and the visor without removing and reinstalling the visor.The jury is out regarding airflow. Further comparison with other helmets is needed to reach a conclusion. Preliminary indications are that airflow is comparable to both the GT Air and the Neotech.A Sena 20S headset (with in-helmet speakers and microphone) was easy to install.The cheek pads and liner were quite absorbent and easy to remove, clean and reinstall. Dust accumulated in the visor mechanisms but was easily removed with running water (with the visor removed).The only feature this helmet is lacking is an integral sunshade. That was sorely missed. I will purchase a dark visor to compensate for this.\n",

It might be slight differences in foam, etc... seems to be overall just a hair less volume.Pros: Looks great. Quiet at speed. Shield and visor are mounted independently. Visor vents pretty much eliminate wind drag. Goggle centering ridge. HUGE field of view. Cons: MUCH HOTTER than VFX-W. Venting works ok at speed but not good at slower pace. Perhaps they made the new chin vent too small. $500+ is a lot of money.Overall: Excellent Dual Sport helmet if the focus is not dirt. Perhaps the best aerodynamics and road manners of any dual sport helmet. MUCH quieter than the VFX-W MX helmet at speeds above 20mph but also MUCH hotter below 20mph.\n",

      "Shoes X2 Hornet Helmet\n",
      "The Shoei X2 Hornet helmet is a fantastic product for what it is. The helmet is a bit heavier that other helmets that I have worn, but it is the most comfortable - comparable in comfort to the X-11 and X-12. The peak/visor is great at blocking the sun and also catching in the wind at speed. Slightly tucking the chin when riding sitting upright at speed makes the drag from the peak diminish significantly. Over 60mph or so for an extended period of time will give your neck a workout due to the wind drag on the peak - so you will develop good neck muscles, which may be a unintentional secondary safety function as your cervical spine will be better protected by the new muscles grown my wearing the helmet. Vents are great, but the mouth vent could be bigger for aggressive riding in colder or wetter weather. Opening the visor a crack makes the noise increase (whistles a bit) but opening the visor fully makes the whistle go away. Internally, the pads are comfortable, cleanable and replaceable. Great dual sport or enduro helmet.\n",

      "Excellent DS Helmet\n",
      "I debated which DS helmet to buy for a long time prior to this purchase. I was very near buying one of the competing options when I switched at the last minute. The only negative I have encountered with the helmet so far is that it is a little heavy. This is noticeable in slow-speed, standing style riding where there isn't airflow to counterbalance. However, at speed the aerodynamics are fantastic. There is virtually no pull on the peak of the helmet compared to other options I have ridden with. I ride a 690 Enduro with the Rally Raid fairing kit. I am 6' and normally have a lot of stalled airflow hitting me mid visor. With the X2 I have no buffeting, very little noise, and no drag on the peak.My head size was right in between medium and large. I went with the large because my medium vfx-w is too tight to wear a balaclava under. I will likely purchase the thicker cheek pads since I am a gaunt fellow and find it just slightly too loose at the bottom. Otherwise the fit is great.Over-all construction is what you would hope for from a Shoei. Good materials, great optics, cool fabric. Airflow is good. On a cool day you can immediately feel a temperature change on parts of your head that you do not otherwise have direct airflow on when opening vents.\n",

      "DS Helmet you can live with\n",
      "This helmet has extremely good aero for a DS. I can run the peak on the highway and it is very neutral at 70-80mph looking ahead. There will be a tug if you try and check your blindspot on the highway, but other than that it is very civil. I love the functionality and looks of the peak, but wasn't sure it would be tolerable on the street. So far all of the 500 miles I've ridden in this helmet have been with peak on. I've ridden down to around 15*F and it's comfortable with a balaclava or neck gaiter. You will need to use the pinlock to keep it from fogging with all the vents closed. I'd like it if Shoei comes out with a plug for the top vent, so we have the option of running without the peak. The peak swaps on and off in a matter of seconds, and the visor mounting system is also excellent. I bought a tinted visor for day rides and use the clear visor with sunglasses for commuting. There are slots in the padding for glasses and I feel no additional pressure on my temples wearing my Oakley sunglasses. I can't comment on the airflow, as I've only ridden in this helmet up to about 70*F tops. I can at least wear sunglasses and keep the visor open if I'm in city traffic.The visibility of the eye port is excellent. My previous LS2 full face helmet cut off right above my side mirrors, which required me to look down and left/right to check my mirrors. With the Shoei Hornet X2 I can keep my head straight and just glance at them.I would say this helmet is reasonably quiet. It is slightly quieter than my previous LS2 full face, but still very loud on the highway. I wear ear plugs nearly all the time, which allows me to hear my Sena SMH-10R better.Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a DS style helmet they can wear on the street. The value at this price point is very good. The liner is comfortable, high quality, and easily removable, and the paint seems to be more resistant to chipping than my $200 LS2. I got 2 years of service out of my LS2 and fully expect to get 3 or 4 out of this.\n",

      "My main reason for getting a new helmet was the poor optical quality and fogging of my old helmet. I live in the PNW and this time of year (feb-mar) is a terrible time for fogging. This helmet with the evo pinlock has eliminated my fogging problem, period. I've used every treatment out there with limited success. Very happy to say my problem is solved. Next is clarity. A few times I have grabbed at the shield to put it down only to realize it is already. It really is that optically correct. I didn't realize how good it could be. Its as clear as a pair of high end sunglasses. I simply don't notice it.Visor lift. I assumed when I bought this helmet that I would take the visor off. Lift on my old helmet was nearly dangerous, especially when doing lane checks. Lift facing forward is non existent. Balance is perfect. Lane check lift is very minor. It is more of course but not distracting or unbalancing. Visor is also at a useful level for blocking sun but not obstructing my view. Leaving it on.My only issue with the helmet is the amount of wind through the helmet opening around my neck. It seems that wind hits my jackets collar and shoots up the neck hole. I have the chin screen on but still notice it. Tends to dry my eyes a bit. Comfort is exceptional. Quality is very nice. A solid feel and a good feature set and accessories. Definitely worth the money.\n",

      "I came from owning a Shark Eplorer R to the Shoei.Shark spoiled me with the bluetooth battery pocket, sun shield, peak combo, weight and general finish. However the helmet pushed hard against my forehead when touring in headwind. So I needed a new one.Bought the shoei after trying on the Arai (cramped), AGV (cheap), etc.I like the fit, it holds you on the cheek and back of the head (I have a Michael Schumacher head), no force on the forehead. For my extra long chin the optional curtain is perfect and covers well without restricting airflow.Comfort level is high and it really takes a strong crosswind to move your head around, even without a windshield. Top notch.Ventilation isn't as extreme or good as the shark, but it gets the job done. I rode 1500km from Johannesburg - Lesotho in 34 - 43(!) Celsius weather and at no point did the helmet let sweat or get my hair wet.Safety seems good, hope to never have to test it.Visor removal is dead simple, not as easy as the shark, but easily done under a minute.Drawbacks / Cons:-If you are wearing earplugs or headphones, the helmet will cause you ear pain, so remove the ear covers or use smaller earplugs. This issue lasted for the first 1000km and then settled, either the helmet shaped or my ears adjusted.-Riding in traffic I miss the option of just lifting the visor a mm for ventilation like the Shark, the pinlock does an amazing job with anti-fog, but I would prefer more airflow.Price: Here I don't know if the price is warranted. The helmet seems lacklustre compared to others. Yes, it is a refined product, manufactured to a high standard, but I expect a lot more extras. An extra lens would have been nice.Would I buy this helmet again? Yes. Would I shop around for a different option that offered more at a lower price? Yes.\n"

      "I am a brand new rider... Always been into road and mountain bicycles but have owned and ridden a motorcycle for only 3 weeks as of today. When shopping for a helmet, I was looking for the best protection, a peak, super wide vision, and an \"open\" comfort quality to it. I do not like feeling plastic a mere inch from my skin, nor my hot humid breath for that matter. I went to numerous stores and tried on every brand you can think of. Literally put on about 50 different helmets. After my ears were torn to shreds I was convinced this was the one to get because it met all criteria previously mentioned, and honestly just felt good. I was told by numerous people that I have a shoei head.No complaints about it really... It performs like I expect it to. I'm convinced the gills in the peak work. I'm upright on a dual sport and doing 80 down the freeway isn't a big deal. But when you do a head check at those speeds, flex your neck as hard as you can. The peak is also great. The sunshine can be pretty brutal here in LA county and keeping the sun out of my eyes with the peak is my life's goal. The non-claustrophobic feeling is awesome too. i can scratch my nose under the chin with gloves on. I like that.\n",

No obstruction looking out the corner of my eyes. I need \"wrap-around\" sunglasses. The old helmet blocked some of the light that would come in the sides.The fit is great, very comfortable, even from the start.What I don't like:It feels 'top' heavy (compared to my old RF-1100).With the peak on, it's about 1-1.5 inches higher, so it doesn't fit in my top case.Buffeting ... wasn't really sure what to expect, and since I don't have another DS model brand to compare to, I can't say if the Shoei is better or worse that previous version or something from another company. (It is really good up to ~80mph with little cross wind. But in the afternoon when the winds kick up, I feel it.)Lack of air-flow. I think it could use a larger chin vent and a couple on the top instead of just the one.It's loud ... or rather, it's not any quieter that my old helmet. Other reviews talked about how quiet this helmet is, so I expected it would be \"really\" quiet. (I still need to wear ear plugs.)Overall ... yes, I'd recommend someone taking a serious look at this helmet.\n",

There seems to be a bit more wind noise however I have not used the chin attachment piece to help reduce that issue. The bill is also very easy to detach if you want to ride without.

      "I upgraded from a Scorpion EXO-R410 to this helmet. It is a huge difference. The Hornet is better in 90% of the areas. I installed my Sena SMH10 on the helmet. Overall it works well. The earphone cups are just a tad small for the circumference. Also, the way the cheek pad locks into the rear of the helmet inhibited the wiring from being able to be run without trimming the edge of the plastic slightly.The biggest thing I miss from the EXO is the faceshield venting system. I was able to lock the faceshield open just a crack to help vent it. Now in extreme conditions I have to open the shield to the first notch and get a little rain in the face. The pinlock system works most of the time, but I did have it fog up with my heavy breathing during some offroad riding in the rain.The new visor is great. I barely notice it even at highway speeds.Overall this is a wonderful helmet, and I’m glad I chose it over all the others. I wouldn’t complain about the helmet at all, but since this is a review I figured that I would point out the few difficulties I’ve had. None of them would make me change my mind though, just hopeful improvements in the future.\n",

      "I owned the first gen Hornet DS and loved it. When I retired it I tried to save some money and bought a cheaper brand. Two years later I'm still fighting neck problems from the peak yanking my head back (I ride a dual sport - no fairing) so I gave in and bought the new Hornet. In 40 years of riding this is by far the most comfortable helmet I've ever worn, and it's got the widest view and best airflow too.You get what you pay for and you'll be happy you bought this helmet.\n",

      "What took me so long to buy a better helmet\n",
      "I've ridden for about 2 years now. I am a very active rider from the day I could legally ride.I chose a Fox DS helmet. It was great for a guy who had never had a helmet on for hours and hours at a time. 2 years later, on a whim, I went and tried on this helmet. It felt like it was made for my head. I even described it to my friends as \"it feels like a Va#$%^ on my head\". Really. That good.Well after ordering this helmet off of revzilla for $200 cheaper than everywhere else, I took it for a test ride. OMG. Quiet, comfortable, smooth. It was everything I had wanted out of my other helmet that I never knew I wanted. My Scala rider speakers fit in the recesses and I cant even feel them in there. Sound was so good, I had to turn the volume down to almost nothing and I could still hear it.For the people who are shopping for a helmet and have never ridden with one for 13 hours, DO NOT BUY the cheapest street legal helmet you can find. Try a Shoei, Arai, etc. Get something you will be happy in and you will want to ride for many more hours.Thanks for reading my extremely satisfied review of this awesome helmet.\n",

      "So far I'm loving this helmet. It worked great for a recent 5-day trip across the country. Seems very well-designed. The visor was a great improvement from my old helmet--it lets the air through and reduces the stress on your neck. Shield sealed well. I decided against using the pinlock piece for this trip because with it and my polarized sunglasses my vision got a bit funky and I didn't anticipate needing extra fog mitigation. But I'll surely try it out on cooler, rainier, and/or slower-traveling days. I gave it a 4 for durability because it's too early to tell, and on bang for buck because it hasn't been long since I shelled out the cash.\n",

Superior ventilation, face shield sealing, noise reduction and the visor is way better. I had my original Hornet for almost 5 years and it did it's job big time. Is the Hornet X2 expensive? It's all relative what do you think your life is worth, for me it is a cheap price to pay for protection.\n",

      "I've been riding with various full face Shoei helmets exclusively for over 25 year so I can't compare it to other styles or brands, and this is my first dual sport helmet so...Yes, it's a little more noisy then the X-12, and yes it does pull a bit at speed (but what should you expect with a beak on your face). These are small prices to pay for the comfort and protection. This is hands down the most comfortable helmet I've ever worn. Full face helmets have always seemed claustrophobic to me. Not this one. \"Wide open\" are the words that come to mind. Protection, it's a high end Shoei with a 2015 Snell rating. That says it all. I cant speak for everyone, but I don't mind spending a little more money to protect my skull.Hand over the cash and enjoy the ride!\n",

      "Fantastic adventure helmet\n",
      "This is my first high quality helmet, I always stayed under the $200 mark and I'm very happy I landed on this. I was deciding between this and the NEXX adventure helmet, the X2 does not have as many features as the NEXX but it makes up in style and comfort. I was a little reluctant with the simplistic chin and front vent but it has really grown on me, simply a beautiful helmet and profile.I also purchased the dark smoke visor (looks f'n sexy), very simple to put on. The visor locks down nice and really creates an airtight seal, I have been through a couple small rain bursts but nothing to really make claims of it's waterproof ability, but so far all dry. I have not used the pinlock yet, since it's hot in Texas and not much of a chance to fog up.The peak gills move air very well and I can't tell it's there facing straight ahead. Head checks you will feel it, but nothing compared to my last dual sport helmet, that thing would blow all over so I have gotten used to it. I did try removing the peak and the quick releases on the sides are very easy, the top however is not the most accessible button/release, you really gotta push on that sucker and the plastic is HARD.The overall fit is snug, I thought too snug at first because it's tight getting on and off, but once it's on it's very comfortable. Once complaint would be I wish the neck strap was a 1/2\"-1\" longer, I can get the helmet off without undoing the D ring but it's tight, little more room to would have been nice.I also installed a SENA 20s system, fits right in but the cutaways they provide fits the speaker, but not the wire :) so that was kind of a fail, but it worked well for the foam offset pad SENA provides, so they do sit nice and close to my ear without touching.Overall, I love this helmet and am very happy. Revzilla of course shipped super fast as usual.\n",

I live and ride in a subtropical area and the ventilation is really good. My only gripe is the visor pulls at any speed over 40 mph. This caught me off guard the first few times and jerked my head around. I'd recommend it to the dual sport or adventure rider who occasionally gets up to highway speeds, but there are better road only helmets.\n",

      "Great Lid... Only 1 Complaint\n",
      "I upgraded from the Shoei Hornet Sonora to the X2. At first it was a little tight on the forehead, but over time the helmet has formed to head and it is comfortable... with one exception. I use the Sena 20s in my Hornet X2 and the 'ear hole' area inside of the helmet is not quite large/deep enough to fully accept the Sena's speakers and my the top of my ears are slightly smashed... which causes some discomfort. The old Hornet with a Sena SMH10 did not have this issue. I think the only way to make it more comfortable would be to remove some material from EPS, which I fear may compromise the helmet (warranty? and or safety?). I just got back from an 8 day trip through the Nevada desert and after encountering 100+ degrees temperatures as well as some freezing rain, the Hornet X2 was great (except again for the ear discomfort - which was mainly noticeable when the helmet was first put on). I like the upgraded features of the X2 (the Pinlock that comes standard with the helmet - I had to upgrade my original Hornet with a pinlock ready shield from Shoei and then also purchase the pinlock insert - which does offset the price of the new X2; The ease of removing the shield - no tools required; and The increased / redesigned airflow of the visor has help immensely with the helmet not catching the wind/buffering and thus has reduced the fatigue on the neck). Overall, I love this helmet... just got to work on creating more space for the Sena speakers in the helmet.Also to note: I have a 'Shoei' head and these helmets fit my head shape, whereas the Arai XD4 was too 'round' and placed to much pressure on my forehead.\n",

It can be a little loud but I am catching wind off my windscreen right in the shield causing some buffeting. The pinloc system is included and works fantastically. I chose this helmet over others due to the fact that i can remove the peak, and or screen w/o any tools on the trail if needed. All pieces are replaceable if broken as well which is great.

First ride the helmet felt great it is quiet and comfortable. I was surprised that there was very little pull from the beak. I thinks is even quieter than my RF1200. The visibility is incredible out of the wide opening. Air flow is adequate, if it gets hot i just crack the face shield. Using a camel back to drink water is no problem, plenty of room with the skirt removed. The helmet did feel a little tight on the forehead, i have been told i have a big head, but after a full day of riding the pads formed to the shape of my head. The only thing i wish is that it had a drop down sun visor, other than that its a great all around helmet.\n",

I actually ordered the Nexx XD1 initially hoping it would be a quality unit, I was attracted to all of all of the features it had. In the end it just didn't measure up. I wanted the integrated sun visor but the build quality, comfort and noise left me unsatisfied. The Hornet is everything you'd expect from a Shoei.\n",

      "Excellent design, watch size carefully\n",
      "I wanted to move up from my Bell Vortex (excellent lid, BTW) and decided on the Shoei X2. The design is exactly as advertised. The peak is very low noise, low drag. Very little drag on head checks, I can move in all planes without resistance, and in corner checks I notice not much more than with my peak less Bell.. I wear ear plugs, but rode without once and it lets in as much less noise than my other helmet. This lid is very light, much lighter in feeling than the Bell. The view is amazing: I can't see the helmet unless I really look. The peak is small and effective. The speakers of my Sena are pretty close to my ear, so I am using less volume (remember, ear plugs) and it sounds clearer with less road and air noise. I like chin curtains and this removable one is large, works well. The foam that wraps around your head does make getting it on a bit more work, but I feel really tucked in once on. I can feel the snug foam of the liner settling in and the fit improves within a few seconds of putting it on.Be careful with sizing. I am an XL in Bell, but measured at 59cm, so got the L in Shoei. The fit once on is perfect, snug, and once on settles on very comfortably. But getting it on requires a lot of pull to keep my ears on, and getting it off is very difficult. I wanted to return it for a size up but have scuffed it, so I own it. It's already breaking in so I expect it will get easier to remove, but it catches my ears and face. I can deal, it fits so well once in place.So all in all, the helmet rocks, glad I picked Shoei, would by it again!\n",

      "Premium helmet, for premium price\n",
      "This is my initial review after a two-hour ride, my first with the helmet. Bike: 2014 BMW R1200GS. Riding experience: 42 years. Location: Around Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Roads, half paved \"B\" roads, and half gravel. Windshield position at lowest. Temperature: + 24 C. Weather sunny, with a light breeze. Time of day: mid-day.This helmet fits my head perfectly. I purchased the Hornet II based on reviews (especially the Revzilla review), and after never having seen, or even tried on the helmet. Purchased it on-line because none of the local bike shops were going to stock the helmet due to price - couple of the shops had not even heard of the helmet, even though they stocked, and sold, Shoei. I tried on other Shoei helmets, including their modular helmet, at bike shows, and at bike dealers. I'd say that if a medium Shoei fits you, then a medium Hornet II will fit similar.Liner - very comfortableOn-off ease. It's new so a bit snug, but not too tight; it'll work in with a few more kilometres wearing it. It is a bit close when pulling on, but once on, fits great.Chin bar: one of the reasons that I wanted this helmet was because the chin bar is slightly farther from my chin than some of the road-only helmets. I use a Cardo Systems bike-to-bike communicator regularly, wanted room for the stick-in mike, and didn't want my chin touching the bar when speaking. There is enough room (and I do not have a large face, or chin).Wind noise. I usually wear ear plugs, but on this occasion did not, because I wanted to see what kind of noise protection the helmet offered. Most of my riding was done at 80 or so kilometres per hour (50 mph), on country roads. There was a slight cross-wind riding in one direction, but not in the other directions. Conclusion: I will still need to wear ear plugs for any kind of highway riding for longer distances.Deflector on the top of the helmet did not seem to affect the wind at all, up to 115 kph (approx. 65 mph) on the highway. In other words, Shoei did a great job of designing the peak.Sunglasses fit well with the helmet on.The visor was crystal clear, at least until that first bug splat. The helmet came with a small bottle of lube for the visor seal, and an anti-fog insert for the visor (which I have not even unwrapped, yet).The vents worked well; the switches for the vents were workable with both regular lined, and with summer gloves (tried both).It has the best rating agency approval ratings.I bought a white solid colour to make me a bit more visible when riding - you don't get to ride as long as I have by riding like you don't want to be seen, :>)Summary: this is a premium helmet, beautifully made, and it looks great too. It's comfortable, and hopefully, I will never have to test it in a get-off to enable me to report on its safety features. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Fits perfect, snug, firm, quiet, light and looks pretty spiffy to boot. This replaced my Nitek modular which was much heavier and more expensive. I do miss the ability to lift the entire face piece up and out of the way to hawk the occasional loogie every now and then, but this is hands down the best helmet I've had in over 20 years. Super quiet, nice wide visibility, multiple stage notches so you can open the screen just a crack to let some air in. The only complaints is that the screen fogs up without the pinlock some cold mornings and the pinlock instructions say you can't ride with it installed at night? Seems this fogging condition should have been designed out at this price point. Not a deal breaker for me though, cold air feels good on the eyes. Also, not a fan of the large hole/vent that remains after you remove the visor, (this is where the air enters for the upper vent), but this looks cheap if you want to ride without the visor. This too should have been designed better, possibly provide a filler plug, propeller on a stick, satellite dish mount or something, c'mon folks, so close to perfection. Maybe these few issues will be resolved on next years model. The shell is a fiberglass base matrix, does scratch pretty easily, and it is made in Japan with a 5 year warranty stamped right on the box, thanks Tommy Boy! Shipping was super fast (as usual) and will continue to buy from REVZILLA.\n",

      "Comfortable and quiet. I don't think I could've chosen a better helmet.The updates that Shoei have made to the helmet make such a difference compared to the last generation and lower priced helmets.Pros:- The redesigned peak: With all of those aerodynamic holes and angles, I didn't feel any lift from the airstream off my tall windshield. It's beautifully balanced, and you don't even know it's there.- Airflow: Wow. Open any vent, and you can feel the airflow. Something I've never experienced from my previous helmets.- The addition of the holes for comm unit speakers is such a simple, but much appreciated feature.I've got two gripes, and really, they're pretty minor ones:- If you want to remove the peak, as Anthony mentioned in the video, you've got a hole left there. It could be solved with a little tape I suppose, but like he says, a plug would be nice. I don't plan on riding without it, but you never know what may happen.- The front vent in front of the mouth: With gloves on, I feel that the lever used is a little small, BUT it is manageable.Overall, ya, it's a little more than the Arai, but I think it's very much worth it after the new updates.\n",

      "I've been looking at DS helmets for awhile, and decided to wait for the X2 to come out, since the biggest complaint I've heard of the style in general is the effects of the visor at highway speeds.I was also thinking about picking up a Bell MX-9 simply due to the price gap. Then I got my hands on a Bell...and decided against it. Nothing against the Bell, it is made to a price point. I suppose when I scuff my +$500 X2 doing 2mph on a little double track I'll be wishing I had cheaped out. But for the daily commute I'll trust my skull to the Shoei.The X2 is more than double the price of the bell, but I would go so far as to say that it surpasses even my RF1200 in nearly every respect. Comfort is phenomenal, I don't know how I lived without a peak (as my commute takes me straight into the rising sun, and at least lets me screen out the sun when it's a few degrees above the horizon). I have a dash riser on my KLR and thought that the airflow that previously hit me right at eyebrow level would be problematic for the peak on a DS helmet, but I have to admit that the X2 is actually better performing than the RF. It's both quieter and less effected by turbulent air. Not really sure how that works...but it does. I've read other reviews stating the helmet 'lightens up' while riding (presumably due to airflow causing lift on the helmet), and I will attest to this as well. While the X2 is slightly heavier than my RF, (the RF is also a SM, my X2 is a MED) it actually feels lighter when I'm at speed.*note on the sizing: the RF was my first helmet, and I am right on the line in sizing between SM and MED in this particular helmet. I figured a slightly more snug fit would be better, and thought the cheek pads would 'break in' over time...they didn't.I should have gone with a MED in that helmet from the get go. I only mention this because I don't want anyone getting the impression the X2 runs larger than the RF (if someone else is in the same boat I was.)...it runs true to size.Head checks are obviously going to be more affected with a peak than the RF would be, but it's only marginal.Yet again, I am reminded \"Buy once, cry once.\" Rarely am I impressed with any product these days, but this helmet is nothing short of fantastic.\n",

The noise level is actually far quieter than my previous helmet: a pleasant surprise. The vents are great as is the visibility. I went to close the shield and it was already closed! It also ratchets nicely to prop it open for a little extra ventilation. Some other helmets don't have a great variety of open positions. It is still in the 30's for my morning rides. After installing the nose shield, the fogging of the shield was eliminated. I am very pleased with this purchase and look forward to years of adventure with it.\n",

      "Best helmet I've ever used\n",
      "first off, This helmet rocks! ..ok, now with that out of the way I'll go into a more detailed review.Sizing - My last two helmets were RF1100 and they both fit me great. Tried an Icon variant - too oval. Arai Defiant - Still a bit oval, loose around cheeks and pressure on my forehead. So, if a certain size shoei fits you now, Id say stick with that size.Padding is very comfy and snug. Helmet feels lighter as youre riding. Pretty light out of the box, but the reviews I watched talked about balance and its very noticeable as the helmet feels lighter when youre moving.Biggest gripe about DS helmets I've read (Im very analytical and have spend more hrs that Id like to admit researching these), everyone complains about the buffeting and wind catching the peak visor. I only got up to 70 today (just got it) and there was the tiniest bit of pull when I looked over my shoulder, but nothing that bugged me at all: very minor. and speaking of looking over your shoulder, I could see much easier since it has a wide lens. WAY better than my RF1100. You dont feel as enclosed since the visibility is amazing.Air flow was actually quite noticeable when I opened the vents. Other helmets you dont seem to feel a huge difference when you open or close. This one you can feel the air flowing in spots you didnt before.Chatter box speaker fit in no problem. Visor locks down really well, so much so that when i closed it my glove got slightly stuck, but came right out of course.All in all I'm extremely happy with this helmet so far. Probably not a sport bike helmet, but for a naked bike (FZ-09), it works GREAT!\n",

Handles great at high speeds, comfortable, love the visor and the air flow. Love the look and feel, I cannot saw enough good things on this helmet. No matter what you ride, i don't think you can go wrong with this helmet. With my harley or my BMW this helmet is perfect.\n",

      "Have always worn HJC modular helmets and tried a LS2 before this one. LS2 had many problems and was returned, after around 600 miles no big complaints about Shark helmet. Only one seems to be a complaint of all 4 people I know who wear them is the shape causes pressure point on forehead. Also speaker holes could be a bit deeper, once speakers are installed the covers press against you ears.\n",

      "The best modular\n",
      "I moved from a couple Scorpion's and tried the Shark so I could flip the chin bar out of the way.  The Shark was too narrow, but looked cool.  Then I saw the LS2 and tried it. Awesome doesn't say enough.  The head shape is great, the fit is just right, and it looks cool.  After years of riding with a modular whose chin bar was straight up, this one wraps all the way to the back.  It truly is the best of all worlds! Slow to moderate speed cruising you flip it to the back.  Smooth movement,  visor pops out of the way, one hand operation, and enjoy the face full old cool air.  Turn you head,  no problem.  It's just like riding with a 3/4 face helmet. Then when you need to transition to the freeway and higher speeds,  just reach back and flip the chin bar back in place,  close the visor, and game on. I can't say enough about how much I really love this helmet. Worth every penny! Thanks RevZilla for selling such great products!\n",

Not only can you ride with it as an open face 3/4 or a full face, you can switch on the fly with one hand.  I rode home from work today in intermittent showers and switched back and forth between open face and full face several times without stopping.  Works great.  My only gripe is that there is only one shell size.  So my medium sized helmet exterior is a bit big.\n",

      "I love the style of this helmet.  I have been wearing a 3/4 helmet and this helmet gives me the choice of 3/4 or full face.  I live in FL , so there will be times I will wear it 3/4. I love the way you can push the button and flip the front of the helmet up and over your head and it clicks in place.  Shark created an excellent design.Date of manufacture is important to me and Revzilla sells \"fresh\" helmets.  The helmet I received was made only 7 months ago. My local stores sell helmets made up to four years old.My head measures 23\" or 58.42cm.  I struggled with sizing since I am on the line.  The printed text on Revzilla's site says it runs small and the video says it runs large.  The cholce for me was medium or large; I settled for a Large.  When I received the helmet, I noticed it's checked 60cm inside which would indicate it's too big for my head.  It seems to fit so I decided to keep it.  I wear glasses and have found that glasses with the straight arms work best to push them on after putting the helmet on.  I have to take my glasses off to put the helmet on and off.The visors have excellent clarity and I especially like the tinted visor.  It is easy to manipulate and the tint and clarity are  light years ahead of the helmet I am replacing.The first thing I noticed after I put the helmet on and started up my bike was how quiet it was.  Yes, you can hear some wind noise when riding.  That is expected on a motorcycle.Anthony and his helmet videos sold me.  Revzilla is a cut above the rest because you took the time and effort to demonstrate and explain your products.  Anthony's knowledge and explanation of each product is impressive.Lastly, my helmet came fast.  It was brand new and in perfect condition.\n",

      "Issues that disuade me from purchasing another SHARK\n",
      "For the price listed I was expecting a helmet of superior quality. I purchased this helmet as a beginner rider, my first helmet. I tried on a couple helmets my friends have an LS2, Bell, Icon, and an HJC. The main issue I had with this helmet is the seals, while properly maintained and lubricated, leak air into the helmet and cause an incessant whistling at anything more than 15-20 mph. I also found a vent filter missing on the chin bar never having dropped this helmet or crashing in it. This shows poor manufacturing and when contacting their customer support with my warranty number they directed me to the retailer saying they can't do anything until I send the dealer my helmet and then it gets forwarded to them after dealer inspection and activation of my warranty which I have already activated. I will not be purchasing another SHARK product and highly discourage anyone from purchasing one as well.\n",

      "I was looking forward to having this helmet. The concept of being able to switch from a full face to an open face helmet is a great concept. However I feel this design needs more refining. First of all this helmet is heavy and when you have the helmet in the open position you can feel the weight at the back of the head,The fit and finish is very nice I must admit. My biggest issue with this helmet is when it is sitting on your kitchen table the mechanical parts work nicely, but when you strap it on and the helmet changes shape the release hardware is VERY hard to operate. I had to pull the on the back of the helmet very hard with both hands to bring the chin piece down to the front. I tried it several times over a 3 month period and decided it was not worth the struggle of switching from full to 3/4 position.Nice idea but I feel the design needs to be improved.I ended up selling it on Ebay.\n",

After a 75 mile ride with chin guard to the back, helmet was very heavy and gave me a headache from my head being pulled back. Even with the chin guard forward and locked in after another ride..about 150miles.. helmet was still heavy and felt like I was bobbin for apples trying to keep my head up. Also with the chin guard locked into place both forward and back, there was a loud whistle and road noise. This was my first ever helmet and wish I could return it and get something else...would not recommend\n",

      "So a lot of people have complained about the cheek pads being too tight.  I did not have that issue; however, the medium I bought is probably a little too big and I probably should have returned it for a small.  I normally wear a medium helmet and I would agree with Revzilla that yes this helmet does indeed run slightly larger than normal and I would order a size smaller than you normally wear.The helmet itself it nice.  It is well built, has high quality materials, and is comfortable.  It was also SUPER easy to install a Sena SMH5 on it.  The opening mechanism from open/closed works well and I have no issues switching between the two, even while riding one handed.The sun visor is a little interesting.  I've never had a helmet with an integrated sun visor.  I guess this visor does ride lower than other visors; however, there's still a \"gap\" in my field up view underneath the visor, which is just weird after having rode with sunglasses for so long.  Also, if you ride with the clear visor up, but the sun visor down, it rattles like CRAZY!  It's super loud and annoying, which basically makes riding with the sun visor down and the clear visor up, or the sun visor down in the open face configuration pointless.The helmet is super comfortable in both the full face position and the closed face position.  Overall I'm happy with the helmet, I think it's a good helmet; however, I wish the sun visor wasn't so loud when it gets hit by wind, I wish it had some type of retention (it slides up and down pretty loosely), and I wish the helmets fit a little more true to size.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet 2-3 weeks ago and have used it on (2) rides of 20 and 80 miles and the helmet functioned excellently.  The ability to open the chin bar is very simple and the opening/closing of the clear face shield and the tinted interior visor are also both quite easy to manage while riding at 70mph+.  My second ride was in a 30mph+ wind and the helmet was very quiet!.I Love This Helmet!\n",

      "Not a bad helmet, but kind of gimmicky\n",
      "I bought one of these because I was looking for a modular helmet and the low profile of the helmet while open appealed to me. I generally only open the helmet to eat or drink on long rides while on the highway so having the chin bar slide up and over seemed like a pretty cool feature as an alternative to having a big sale up on top of my head.And I do like it, but only so much as it does work for what i bought it for- barely. The face shield rattles when it's open. The liner is thin and provides \"a little\" padding. The cheek pads touch my ear plugs even after I've pulled the padding out and even cut the speaker holes open. No bueno. This is probably the biggest downfall of the helmet.So, for the time being, it will do, but it's going to get replaced probably before I've had it a year when I generally keep them for 4 or 5.It's not bad, it's just not \"that\" good.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet based on the measurement of my head using the sizing chart. I measured exactly 56cm but was slightly confused about the sizing, as the description and the video contradict each other. When I called in they recommended I go with the medium. While I was waiting on the helmet to arrive to Revzilla (it was not in stock in that size) I went to a local store that sells this helmet for $459 and tried on a medium and could hardly stand the cheek pads. I tried on the large and the cheek pads were better but it was definitely too big on the head. I immediately came home and ordered the \"thinnest\" cheek pads available, since you can swap them out. BUT they were an additional $51. When the helmet arrived I tried both sets of cheek pads and opted to go with the thinner pads and absorb the extra money. They are still somewhat tight on my cheeks, but the feeling of the fit on my head is GREAT!! I've worn the helmet now for several weeks and must say the cheek pads are breaking in and feeling much better!!I love this helmet!! The fit is great! The option to use it as a full face is awesome!! I don't feel it is noisy at all. I have an Ultra Limited and can still here the bike's radio and navigation just fine, but I don't feel like my ears are hearing \"noise\" as I did in my other full face. The sun visor is perfect! The outer visor is perfect. The helmet is very versatile! The vision is very wide when looking back to change lanes. I installed my Sena Bluetooth system and had no problems! I must say I wore the helmet for several hours for several days before deciding to \"keep\" it and take it out on the bike....and I almost sent it back initially thinking it was just TOO tight on the cheeks. BUT I am glad I kept it!! I absolutely love this helmet now and really don't even know if I'll go back to my half hat next summer unless it simply gets TOO hot. Speaking of temperature...I live in Ohio and have been riding in some cool weather with this and it is very warm when you go with the full face option. Can't wait to see how it performs in the rain!! I definitely recommend the thinner pads if you have rounded or full cheeks, and I definitely recommend sitting in it for awhile before sending it back IF it's tight. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the tight cheeks AND the fact that I had to shell out the extra $51 for the thinner cheek pads! Aside from that it's 5 stars!!\n",

      "Ok. wife and I bought matching shark Evo line 3s we love the full open face and the internal sun visor. the padding is very comfortable and you can fit wire rim glasses in the cheek pads. now this helmet is a bit heavy and the shape is definitely round on the outside. it takes a bit of getting used to based on how big the shell is compared to your head. It is quiet and fit my Sena coms perfectly because of the pre-cut lining. Wife complains of weight after a while but it is a modular after all.\n",

      "Normally my preferred helmet is a half helmet as I don't  like the \"closed in feeling\".  My former modular helmet had become un- comfortably tight for some reason. Since we were going on along trip of over 1000 miles, I wanted the extra protection of a full helmet. This helmet fits the bill and then some - it is really 3 helmets in one. A modular helmet, or a full face helmet or a half helmet. And the chin bar retracts back  where it basically disappears. The helmet is light and has NO pressure points (at least on my head). The airflow seems adequate and the noise level is quite low.  I used to carry 2 helmets - my modular and my half helmet on long trips. No need to anymore as this helmet is all I could want rolled into one. Highly recommended.\n",

      "This is my first helmet. I initially wanted to go with  Shoei as I wanted a good protection.What made me choose that one is that you can truly switch from close to open face and when open, the chin bar fits really nicely on the back and doesn't create an extra drag on top of the helmet like all the other modulars.I also wanted to be able to ride open face at \"high\" speed, and that helmet beat my expectations. I actually always drive open because you can still lower the clear visor and it goes low enough to offer a proper face protection (down to the lips).I tried (in a shop, not riding) both Shoei modular, and shark Evoline, they felt like the same comfort level and weight.I tend to avoid highways, so never go faster than 60-65 mph, and the noise level is pretty nice, even open at those speeds.Switching from open to close or close to open is easily done with a single hand, even while riding (but not recommended by manufacturer).I'm really happy with this product, and when I'll have to change it, I think I will go with Evoline. again\n",

      "I use this helmet riding a GL1800 and a GSX-F 750.  One of my favorite things about it is the way the chin bar rotates to the back of the helmet.  When on the Katana, I have all the wind protection that I could ask for.  When on the Wing, I have to option of stowing the chin bar behind my helmet since I'm hiding behind a full fairing and tall windshield.I wear glasses and unlike previous helmets that I've owned, I have to take my glasses off to put on or take off the helmet.  It is comfortable with glasses and doesn't smash them into my face.I use a Scala Rider G9 with this helmet.

      "Great idea, poor execution\n",
      "I was so excited when I purchased this helmet and took it off on a 5,000+ mile trip around the US. On the very first day, a round button on my sleeve left a huge gouge in the visor, and by the end of the trip, regular use left it with small scratches all across the visor that are very noticeable when driving into the sun or at night. The built-in sunglasses sometimes get stuck or set on the wrong track and have difficulty retracting. The chin strap does not have D rings so I cannot lock it to my bike, and the location of the clip also rubs against my neck and after 10 days of wearing it for 6-12 hours per day, I was left with a bruise on my neck that lasted for over a month.The option to have the chin bar flipped back is great and was very useful for slow rides through scenic routes, however, it would often get stuck up and it would be very difficult to force it back down, especially one-handed while riding.The helmet is incredibly light and comfortable for long trips. One downside is that because the carbon fiber is fairly brittle, I had my helmet resting on my seat and it slipped off landing on a gravel driveway and it left cracks around the impact.The top of the shield is not waterproof either, and when I was caught in the rain the water would drip down directly into my eyeballs, and it would run along the inside of the shield, leaving streaks.There is also no good place to mount a clamp-style comm. system (I have a Scala Q3) so I had to use velcro which also doesn't hold up well in poor weather and I often had it just dangling beside my helmet which caused more wear and tear on the cables.Overall, this helmet has many good features and is amazing in theory, but I had so many surprise issues with it that I would not recommend it and would certainly not buy it again for close to $600.\n",

There is also a cheekpad feature for eyeglass earpieces - watch the video.  Hubby got his first and I waited to see how he liked fit and performance.  He loved it!  We both wore the helmet while watching tv, etc. so we could adjust and do some break-in and get used to the moving parts before taking off on our HD CVO.  If you have questions before ordering, I found the live tech to be extremely helpful and product knowledgeable.

I'm a Road Glide tourer and some Harley guys will probably make fun of the look of the Shark when it's in 3/4 mode.  I don't care; function wins out over style when you've been riding for years.  I do think the sizing runs a little small.  Large is generally a little snug on me with most helmet brands, but the Shark was even more snug.

The thing that forced me to return it is the fact that the visor has a warning on it that says \"not guaranteed shatterproof\". Shatterproofness is an essential quality in a visor in my opinion. This should be specified in the specs or in a review as the warning is not very visible on the visor.\n",

      "I am still waiting for the helmet to come back from J&M where I sent it to have the custom elite series head set installed. Mind you I had it long enough to walk around with it on at home and tear in to its features. First I would like to say Revzilla customer service really ROCKS! Always very very helpful! Back to the helmet, It came packed tightly and securely, all pieces intact and secured to the helmet I did notice first thing was the Titanium silver color which is want I was looking for in a color, marking were subtle but nicely done. I didn't feel like a bill board! The cheek pad as expected were tight due to them being standard size in the helmet. I need the extra large cheek pads to keep from squeezing the c**p out of my face and looking like a gold fish! Revzilla doesn't seem to have enough extra cheek pads in stock. As they said you may want to check around other vendors for that product. The big big I mean big surprise was the fully removalable head liner was not as shown on the videos! The snap system, at least on this series, was no longer available! I was told by Revzilla customer service, that it was a design change and will have the video updated. I could not in my best try get the whole liner system uninstalled. I hope that they revise that video and show the attempt by some one better than me! Everything worked and is as described on the video. I think it will be a great helmet match to my Gold wing!\n",

      "The Shark Evoline has made my 500 mile days easy and my 1k iron butts tolerable.The only problem that I found with this helmet was a piece of foam they put along the brow. My brow has a bit of point to it and the additional foam piece made it impossible to ride more than an hour without severe pain.Once I pulled that piece of dense foam out, I ran tank to tank on the super-slab on a 5 hours tour with no helmet discomfort at all.A note to any earlier Evoline users, I had a Medium in the Evoline 1 series and it was a bit loose. The Large in the E3 is about as snug as I would every want - so if you are in between sizes or right on the high side, go big. They have some beefy cheek pads,This Shark E3 is a much better design than the previous series. It makes the long tour riding that we do so much more enjoyable.\n",

During the hotter part of the day, with the chin bar up and the face shield and sun visor down, I had no excessive noise and good air flow. It provided excellent weather and wind protection with the chin bar down. Beware the fit: I measured and was 2 cm smaller than the lower end of the range for a large, but I had to send it back to get an extra large helmet. Revzilla was great and fast with the exchange. The only down side was they sent the new helmet without the removable micro pads that allow you to get glasses on easily. I expect I will order the newer pads, because it was difficult to get sun glasses on with the older style pads.\n",

It's fairly comfortable, but it's a little shorter front to back and looser side to side than' I'd like.Ventilation is adequate, no complaints as long as I'm moving. If I'm on city streets with frequent stop lights, the chin bar goes to the back, and I wear it 3/4.The cheek pads are a little obtrusive, and I can't get the helmet on without taking my glasses off. Might take the cheek pads out if I can't get used to them. They're removable, so that's a plus.But regardless of these things, there is not a whole lot of choice when it comes to a fully convertible 3/4 to full face. If that's what you're looking for, don't let perfection stand in the way of \"good enough\".\n",

I would give it 5 stars if the chin went to place easier and face shied didn't leak.Pros: Easy to convert to open face, Little wind noiseCons: Bring the chin bar back and locking into place is a choir, I ride in rainy conditions and it leaks down the inside of face shield.

Had problems with the 2 in the visor opening and closing was hard and once I lubricated it then it was too lose and wind buffeting adjusted it. Then it broke, hence the new helmet.However being able to change from open-face to full-face is so good it was worth trying the 3 and I'm glad i did. I normally ride open faced and having a high safety rating with an open helmet is unusual. Being able to close the helmet in bad weather and heavy traffic is also gold. The 3 has fixed most of my irritations from the 2The helmets (2 &3) a bit noisy on the open road but my bikes unfaired and a fairing would change this I think.Overall I really rate these helmets for the type of riding I do, mainly day long rides and long distance.\n",

Anyways, I have been looking at buying a Evoline since 2010 but didn't because it was very round and pricey (British economy). This also is my first modular helmet. I like the flip up option, at the moment its kind of hard for me to work it. Going to take some time to get use to but having the option to flip it up when riding makes a great difference riding in this GA heat. Sun visor is in the perfect spot.

It is a little bit more than I wanted to spend, BUT the main feature of being able to ride with the chin guard in the up position is what sold me. It did take me to the 3rd generation to finally pull the trigger and buy because I wanted more airflow than the predecessors offered. i was hoping that the new design would take care of the airflow, but I think it still needs some work in this area. I think if they could incorporate even 1 larger or 2 venturi vents on the back and a larger intakes on the front and top then it would be absolutely perfect, but I totally understand it's difficult with the way the helmet is designed....Gotta give a little for the other awesome features.

The helmet looks cool too.The things I don't like so much about this helmet are:I wish the sun visor came down a bit lower. It comes down to the tip of my nose and it is a weird feeling. Because of this, some light still gets in my eyes. I'm getting used to it though.I also wish the same sun visor was darker. when it's extremely bright, the sun still bothers me and I end up wearing my sunglasses, which defeats the purpose of having the sun visor.I've been wearing this helmet for a while now, including a week long trip and I still find that it is a tad uncomfortable around my forehead.

The clips that attach lower chin bar to helmet are weak plastic tabs. There is a small amount of play in the lower chin bar when it is secured in the \"full face\" mode. I do not expect this helmet to last very long. The concept of this helmet is amazing and I had high expectations however SHARK needs to pay way more attention to quality.

      "$350 is expensive but certainly fro the price you get an excellent product that is as good or better than $500-$600 helmets. Fit was good for me because my head is more round than oval. When in open-face position it tends to press on your forehead which can become uncomfortable but not severely. I imagine this is an aerodynamic impact, it only happens when you approach 50mph. I wear it in open-face below 50mph and full-face over 50mph, this seems to allow the most comfortable airflow all around. I can see all the way to the edges of my peripheral vision and the vertical range is great too. I bought the gloss black and put a chrome finish visor on it, it looks great but when in open-face I do look a bit like Robo Cop.\n",

The design near the shield hinges makes so much noise I was deafened EVEN WITH 33dB EARPLUGS. Quieter with the chinbar up and away.Replacement face shields are $60+ which is not very reasonable either. when I first got the helmet, the internal shield slider was rattling like crazy. Revzilla helped me to get it fixed but I had to push to do it myself as they wanted me to ship back the unit. Apparently, even the maker or distributor did not know how easy it was to fix and were telling me that I needed to solder something. I fixed it with only a small screwdriver in 15 minutes all told. Looks like a part that will wear out easily as well.

      "I recently bought a cafe racer bike so I thought this would be a perfect helmet for it since I can ride it with chin down in freeways and chin up in the streets. When I received the helmet the first thing I noticed wasn't the cool features such as the internal visor or flip back chin but rather how big the shell size was. I put it next to my 10 year arai (see pic) and you would've thought I bought a xxxxl helmet (I bought a large). After putting it on it not only make me look like a big headed alien but I also noticed that it was a very uncomfortable helmet. It fit my head but the liner felt rough and cheap comparing to my arai quantum ll. In addition, I expected to be heavier since its a modular but it was almost a pound heavier than my arai. My arai weighs 3.4 pounds and th shark was between 4.1 and 4.2 pounds. You can really feel the weight of the helmet when you pull the chin bar back. I was very disappointed as I was really lloking forward to wearing this helmet with the cool features it offers. Maybe their next gen helmet will address these issues.Overall, I couldn't get past the shell size, uncomfortable liner and the weight. I decided to return it and get the superior arai defiant helmet. $130 more but I'm sure I won't be disappointed.\n",

I thought I would use it mainly in 3/4 mode, but frequently used full face (Interstate, hard driven twisters, and rain) too. It works great with glasses with the appropriate removable pads removed. Visor detente system facilitates a wide choice of \"degree of open\" options, including fully open in full or three quarter mode.

      "A fellow MSF Rider Coach had the Evoline 2 and I got a good chance to see the helmet up close. I was very impressed with the functionality of the helmet. I am not one who likes a full face model. I normally ride with a 3/4. When I tour I use to take 2 helmets with me. One for normal riding conditions, and a full face for bad weather. Well, thanks to this helmet I no longer require 2 helmets. This one does it all. I bought the Evoline 3 and 2 days later took off on a 2000 mile ride. It was very comfortable after some minor adjustments with some hot spots but you will get that with all new helmets. It is well balanced and so cool I could ride with it as a 3/4 or when it rained a full face!! I can't say enough good things about the design. What I was most impressed with is how quiet this hemet is. In the full face mode very, very, little wind noise. When in the 3/4 mode, still quieter than my expensive Shoe. Looking for something that does it all? Looking for a quiet helmet that has comfort and protection? Buy the Shark Evoline 3!!!\n",

      "Have had this since it first came out - Bought at premium and should have waited 2 months and bought at Revzilla and saved some $$.Good- Fits my roundish head- Sun visor is not spring loaded or have clicks, just holds where you put it. I use it partially down very often.- Seams reasonably light for a modular- Modular so easy to put on with my glasses- I think it looks cool, even with the chin bar open openBad- Lots of wind noise on my FJR1300. Painfully Loud. Europeans always ride with earl plugs and this is by a French company.- With the faceplace down partly in certain head positions it whistles. The slots in the covers on the sides where the face-shield pivots seem to be noise generators. The noise level and whistle changes as you open/close the face-shield.- Ventilation - fair with visor closed - top vent is useless, bottom does let some air in but only noticable in very cold weather. Most of the air comes in under the chin bar so always have some air blowing around chin and mouth - need face cover in winter.- Leaks in the rain - get water on the inside of the face shield- Takes two hands to lock chin bar. After flipping the chin bar froward you have to push the chin bar toward the helmet while pushing on the back of the helmet with the other hand. You CANNOT drop the chin bar in place and have it secure while on the move. (look ma, no hands?) Trying to lock it with only one hand means punching yourself in the chin bar... errrr.... not comfortable.- Chin bar can be hard to lock in place - it locks on each side and the left side on my helmet take a lot of force. You really need to hear both sides click or the chin bar is not secure.- The rubber U lip where the face-shield seals to the helmet brow keeps bending out (open). This makes closing the face-shield all the way difficult and probably contributes to the leak.- The Sun visor is not polarized. I do like the sun visor slider, that it is far from my face so does not hit my glasses, can come down to the tip of my nose. But it is NOT polarized. It is a good shade of darkness and effective with sun and light, but it is not polarized so glare is not really addressed. I do a lot of night riding and I slide it partly down and tilt my head forward if oncoming car headlights really glare. It works, but not as well as my polarized sunglasses in the car (only half the lens is tinted in the glasses.)- European chin strap ratchet closure - works and is easy to put on, but there are no rings for locking the helmet to the bike. Hmmm.... maybe I should just leave the helmet on the handlebars and hope someone steals it.... Nah. They really should have a D ring or loop in the chin strap.Neutral- The chin bar flipping to the rear of the helmet seemed an attractive feature. However, I find I don't ride in the 3/4 mode much since most of my riding is higher speeds. It works in providing a streamlined 3/4 helmet, but I just don't use it in that mode. After all, I bought a modular because I wanted chin protection.\n",

      "It isn't perfect, but it's pretty close. The only problem I have had is that the cheek pads have some hard plastic backing that is covered by part of the liner. The liner isn't really long enough to cover them properly and you end up getting a sharp piece of plastic dragging across your ear as you remove the helmet, on occasion. WIth a little finesse it can be avoided, but it is a shame since it would such a simple thing to fix by slightly altering the lining.Also, the sizing guide insists that the helmet runs big so if you are in-between sizes you should order the smaller one. Not my experience at all! I followed the advice and ended up with a helmet that was way too small. This helmet is true to size.\n",

In full face mode it feels same like my Shoei Quest, which I love! Sun shade works great, it's in right position, not too low, not too high, works well. The main face shield does excellent job in full face position and in open face position as well.You can buy $700 Schulbert and being stuck with silly bulge on top of your head when bar open with no ability to lower the face shield - thus makes it impossible to utilize it as open face... after you pay $700...

      "This is a great idea for a helmet, and I still want one! However, Shark's implementation is way off. I own a medium HJC helmet that fits and looks just fine. I figured the Evoline 3 would be a good upgrade, but when I ordered the medium I could not even get my head into it. So I sent it back and ordered a large, which fit around the head but pressed in too firmly on the cheeks, giving a \"chipmunk\" appearance. To get a decent fit, I would either need an XL helmet or extra small cheek pads (which are supposedly available but which RevZilla does not seem to carry). And my head is not that large!But while the pads are way too small on the inside, the shell has the opposite problem -- being way too large on the outside. It is 1.25\" taller, 0.5\" longer, and 1\" wider than the HJC, and while that may not sound like much, the difference in appearance is pretty dramatic. When I squeezed the helmet down over my head, my wife immediately started laughing and said, \"You look like a bobble head.\" I found a mirror, and yep, she was right. Sigh.I really really want a helmet exactly like this, but with much smaller shell dimensions and much thinner padding, so it looks and fits like a normal U.S. helmet.

The fact that it stows in an aerodynamic fashion that is integrated into the design of the helmet made it the only real choice, at least for me. There are times when I would only want to wear a full face and other times when I really desired an open face. This helmet allows me both in one and with decent style too. The integral visor is icing on the cake. Now I don't need to worry about breaking my sunglasses after sticking them in my pocket when I'm returning at night.\n",

I'll just glue them back on.Because of the sun visor feature, I think, the helmet sits very tall on the top of the head, and frankly looks a bit silly when worn in the 3/4 position. That's the same for all of these types of helmets, though.Only real negative is that most of us who prefer matte black like the color because of its subtlety.

      "I've had my sights set on getting a Shark Evoline 3 for almost a year. It took ages for anywhere to restock them in my size (small).I've seen a few reviews that suggest that the rotating chin bar is \"flimsy\" or \"cheap\" but I think it is of the same quality as the shell and or the shells of my other helmets.I've gotten quite a lot of compliments on the look of the helmet, which I didn't expect at all, and a few riders repeatedly mention how \"jealous\" they are that I can so easily and quickly change from a full face to an open face (or vice versa) and not worry about a tremendous amount of drag or the \"grandpa/touring\" look of most modular helmets.My biggest complaint is that the chin strap is a little tight. When I first put the helmet on, I thought I might need to send it back for a larger helmet, but I hesitated because the rest of the helmet fit so well. After a little bit of riding, the chin strap started becoming less tight feeling and irritable and now I don't even notice it being tight anymore.I only withhold the excellent rating for durability and protection because if you wear it in the 3/4 set up you will obviously not be as protected as when the chin bar is down in the full face configuration. It is not the materials.The air flow is limited as the video points out, but the new channels in the foam allow a lot more heat to vent and air to flow as well as the option to simply open the mask for wind int he face if you're too hot.Obviously this helmet is all about the convenience and functionality of having two helmets, on the fly, in one. I can only say, if you're looking for a full face or a 3/4 and you're on the fence, this is probably the solution you're looking for.\n",

The helmet feels great both open and closed (although when closed it is noticeably more snug.)

And when I did manage to pull it all the way down onto my head, there was extreme pressure on my forehead :-/ But my motorcycle dealer showed me how to press on the styrofoam (not sure if that's the actual material, but it looks/feels like styrofoam) and you can actually indent it however much you like to allow for a more perfect fit. So I just kept pushing it in little by little until the fit was just right! (CAUTION: when you do this, make sure to push in only a tiny bit at a time as this is not reversible! If you push/crush too much, there's no expanding the foam back out) So once I did this, it fit perfectly!I absolutely love the ability to transform from full face to open face and it streamlines quite nicely in the open face position. Of course it does make the helmet a bit heavier because of the extra mechanisms I'm assuming, but that was not a deterrent for me. I live in Hawaii where I have to ride for a while in the humid hot air before I can get to the areas that are colder so it's a wonderful feature to be able to start out with open face, then transform to full face when I need.\n",

      "I've been an HJC owner for years, but after seeing the Evoline 2 demonstrated on this site I began to think a helmet that would allow me to have a half-helmet or a full-faced helmet all-in-one would be a good upgrade. I took a chance (I've never dealt with Revilla before) and ordered the Evoline 2. When it arrived I was a little discouraged and disappointed with the fit -- it as too round. I returned it and, reluctantly asked that it be replace with the Evoline 3, What a difference! Lower weight, better fit, and much easier to operate the chinbar mechanism. I would highly recommend the helmet and Revilla. Revilla made the whole process easy and quick. Even the return process and subsequent relacement order were handled without any hassle. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Evoline 3 or Revzilla.\n",

      "The features are great; but, the cheekpads cause considerable discomfort\n",
      "I've got about 8 hours of riding time with this helmet, having completing about 4 hours yesterday. All of the features are great. The chinbar does create noticible drag when it is in the up position at speeds over 60 mph. The helmet (large) fits the crown of my head just right; however, the cheek pad pressure is unbearable. I did some web research, noticed that others were experiencing the same problem with this and found out that replacement pads weren't yet available.With nothing to lose, I performed surgery on mine after yesterdays' ride. I used a box cutter to cut open up the hard plastic backing on the pads. I found 2 colors of foam (green and white). I removed most of the green foam which was located in the centers of the pads and left the white foam which is located on the borders of the pad. I applied duct tape to seal the incision that I made in the plastic backing. It feels much better; but, I've haven't performed a test run on the road yet.I can't recommend this product until the cheekpad issue is resolved.\n",

      "I have just received this helmet and have only ridden with it a few times, but so far I love it. I truly gives you the best of both types of helmets in one. The weight is very light and with the chin bar back it is very well balanced and not a factor in the wind at all. Visibility is great with almost full peripheral and no distortion in the visors. Overall I'm very satisfied with it and VERY satisfied with Revzilla. This was my first purchase from them and it won't be my last. Love the videos, they were very helpful in showing the product and comparing them. The shipping was extremely fast, Great Job Revzilla !!!\n",

      "Nice features, poor build quality\n",
      "I was really happy to finally find these helmets in the states. And ordered one quickly. I have a big head, and ordered and XL. It fit very well, which was a surprise, and was comfortable. Though my motorcycle experience is limited, I found the helmet very quiet.I also ordered the shark tooth kit for this helmet, and that is where things went wrong. First. Removing the neck guard is very diffiicult, and the plastic piece that holds it in place popped half off while trying to remove the neck guard. Looks like they simply glued it there on top of the paint! Oh well. I can super glue it back I figured, and continued with the installation. Put the speakers in place and tried it on. More problems. Was rather painful up at my ears very quickly. The speaker wells were no where near deep enough to accommodate the shark tooth speakers. This may only affect the xl version, since the large version would have more padding and keep the riders head a bit further from the shell, but alas, is still a problem. In addition, the placement of the speaker wells are about an inch above and behind where ones ear canal would be. Luckily the sharktooth is nice and loud and that odd placement didnt seem to affect volume too much. After futzing around all night with placement, I finally decided i was keeping the helment and to remove some of the styrofoam to set the speakers in more deeply. Did so. Finished the shark tooth install. Worked fine. Reassembled the helmet and used some super glue to reseat the neck guard holder thing.used a small bit of cheap, barely useful packing tape to hold the pieces together while the glue set. Removed the tape the neck morning, and a BIG chunk of paint comes peeling off the helmet. Seriously? No protective coating n the paint at all? . The same thing happened again today while placing a camera mount. Huge chuck of paint peeled off while trying to reposition the sticky pad, and ended up having to trash that mount. Glad I got two of them. So, while the helmet is quite comfortable and quiet, and I love the flip around chin guard, I must say the helmet is very poorly put together, and I would have exchanged it had I not already voided the warranty by modifying it. For a helmet this expensive, I would have expected much better. Mark me disappointed and irritated. Never had problems like these on any of my helmets, even the low end ones.\n",

      "Not a bad deal\n",
      "Ok, so I did a lot of taking apart and never road with this helmet because a piece broke off while removing the sun visor. I did find out a lot about it though.First, the air flow: obviously I didn't ride with it, but from comparing the look to my other helmets I would say the airflow comes mostly from having the helmet open. It has nice deep air channels, but the top vent seems small and there are no exhaust vents on the back.The interior: I measure right at 23 inches in the head, I have an average shape head and a medium fit well, but may be just a bit too snug. All of the materials are very comfortable and seem to be high quality. In addition there seems to be great effort in hiding snaps behind foam which greatly helps comfort. the 3D liner also has mesh vents on top to help let heat out. All components are easily removed and re-installed. There are also inserts where the sharktooth thing would otherwise be installed.The sunvisor: It's pleanty dark and comes down far enough on the face to cover the entire field of view. The mechanism is also easy to use with gloves on. HOWEVER, the sunvisor is connected to the lever by a long strip of metal connected to a small piece of plastic which was no glued to the metal. As a result when following directions removing the sunvisor, it popped that little bit of plastic off and I couldn't get it back on. This would easily have been prevented with a drop of glue or having the plastic connector to the sunvisor and metal strip on opposite sides. I hope this is a one helmet case.The face shield: It seems durable, the field of view is nice and wide, I experienced no fogging while sitting on my couch. It is also easily removed and re-attached.The chinbar: It has no chin curtain, as it would be in compatible with rotating the chinbar back. Also the directions of the chin vent seem to place as much air on your face as on the face shield. The mechanism rotates pretty smoothly, but I would only do it while stopped until familiar with it, despite the fact that I was able to do it with one hand.Other thoughts: I can't believe the sunvisor thing was more than a one time slip up, there is too much good work into this helmet. The chin strap could use some additional padding though. Over all construction seems to be very good. I would recommend this helmet to those who prefer open face helmets, but would like the option in bad weather. They also seemed to make a big deal about the weight and how close the shield stayed to the helmet when up. Both are very good, it barely weighs more than my fairly high end closed face and the shield stays very close to the helmet.In other news I made a helmet review I will upload to youtube which should have a link below if interested, please feel free to watch me stumble over my own words.\n",

      "loudest helmet ever.  foggy as hell, shield changing is ridiculous,beak visor is useless, anti fog is a sick joke\n",
      "there you have it, and I am not exaggerating.   can't know this till you've worn it and therefore stuck with.  shamefully...no  abusively loud, hearing loss loud even with earplugs.  the supposed anti fog coating is a useless sticky finish that seems to incite fog rather than prevent it.  it will find any lint even in lint free cloths, pull it out and stick to the lens of the sun visor or dual shield.  the dual shield is a joke, not sure how it doesn't avoid fog like a pinlock, being seemingly the same thing, but no, it fogs at every temperature.  Fogging at 60 degrees?  that won't go away at 60mph? also the chin strap is set far back into your neck, takes some getting used to, as getting choked tends to require I suppose.   I will never take this helmet again on an all day trip, abject misery, mostly the unbelievable noise amplification.  the designer of this helmet should be released from Scorpion for completely ruining what  should have been a great set of features at a reasonable price, I really don't even know what they had to do to affect such a noisy helmet, this is WITH EARPLUGS, and careful air management on the bike.  I'm pretty disappointed I can't now put the money into a more pleasant helmet.  the fit is great and very comfortable, just totally overshadowed by the major problems of the helmet.  Anyone who says this is average loud is in a car or traveling moped speed.  They were very wise to make the sun visor amber vs. smoke.  amber is great for any condition IMO.  The off road beak is a costume prop, and makes changing / removing shields a royal P.I.T.Ass.  And why no thumb screws so you don't have to keep coins or tools with you and dig them out to remove the shield to change to a different deafening noise pitch when the other is driving you insane inside the shield.  If you let out a moderate breath through the nose at 75mph 80 degree temp, you will completely fog your shield for several seconds, HOW?!!  got suckered in by a modular that would accept goggles and the amber drop down.  lesson learned.  Scopion, have someone actually use the helmet before you bring it to market with the empty, more like patently false marketing.  that fog pitch... wow, I would like to meet the guy who brought the 'let's add a sticky, sort of hazy finish to all the plastics and tell people it resists fog and it actually increases it'--  Please get a wind tunnel and familiarize yourself with the concept 'velocity of sound', there is a reason polycarbonate is used in congo drums, djembe's etc and even all-weather stringed instruments.  poor choice for something residing an inch from the ear.  oh, and ventilation, zero.  open the the vents you won't detect a thing, you'll have to pop the shield a notch.   choosing it, wish I hadn't.  oh well.  sounded good on paper.\n",

      "The modular chin guard, flip-down internal shade, and sun guard come together with surprisingly good aerodynamics to make this a great helmet. However, if you have a windscreen, airflow through it is terrible which results in fogging. The breath guard interferes with most communicator boom mics, and removing it exacerbates the fogging issue. Scorpion does offer an electric defrost face shield and pin inserts, but out-of-the-box airflow leaves much to be desired.\n",

      "No9w that I've been running this helmet for a year, in all weather, I am ready to give it a more comprehensive review. I have been riding KLRs since 2006. And the biggest problem that I've had with helmets is the field of vision. I needed a helmet that allowed me to see my instruments without having to look down. With the goggle-compatible concept, I get that. I'm also a big guy. Many helmets are more than a little crowded for me. The extended chin bar provides ample room up front. The helmet itself is fairly comfortable and the sizing is true. I'm 6'2\", 200# and wear a 7 3/8 hat. The large helmet fits perfectly. Though the airflow needs improvement, it's not terrible. You might have to monkey around with the air dam ine the chin bar to get the right airflow - especially with the breath box. I wanted a ADV helmet, but I also wanted a modular helmet. Since the only other option was astronomically out of my price range, this was the best option. It also has features the Shuberth doesn't. Did I mention that I love the amber inner shield? I have used this helmet in all weather conditions, including snow (I live in Eastern Washington). While there is some fogging issue, even with the breath box, the dual lens does mitigate freezing. The face shield design provides a good seal, even in heavy rain. The only detractions (aside from the airflow) I have are the dual lens shield can rub on the peak visor, leaving rub marks on the visor. Secondly, it seems to have a problem with the chin bar mechanism. My chin bar release broke last week, leaving the chin bar locked in the down position. However, I did contact Scorpion, and the sent me a new release lever. Overall, I'm still very pleased with this helmet considering what I paid for it. Good helmet.\n",

      "On paper, this helmet checks all the boxes. But the execution is so poor, it's impossible not to be thoroughly disappointed. Keep in mind this review is from a Florida rider, so you may do better in a milder or less humid climate.Cons:1. You have a sun peak, but it's too narrow and high up in your line of sight to be of any use (doesn't block the sun... at all...).2. You have a sun visor, but it's not dark enough to be effective in direct sunlight. Not to mention it fogs up most of the time, even on normal sunny days.3. It's comfortable around the head, but the ear pockets are too shallow making you want to cut the tips of your ears off after half a day's ride.4. It's designed to install a comm unit, but there's no way to string the wires without making permanent alterations to the liner.5. The Scorpion Everclear coating is one of the worst inventions to ever go into a helmet... Not only is the performance terrible (maybe slightly better than a standard visor), but the tacky finish means you can never ever clean the inside of your visor properly. You WILL want the pinlock visor, which puts the cost within range of far FAR better helmets.6. Ventilation isn't bad, but the front vent isn't sufficient. You have to choose between venting your face (visor open) or your head (visor closed). Yes cracking the visor gives you a little of both, but I stress the word \"little\".7. Finally, this helmet is LOUD.Though I wish I never bought this helmet, there are some things this helmet does well.Pros:1. Though you can't get good ventilation for both face and head simultaneously, I'll admit that this has some of the best airflow I've felt around the head with a fully shut visor.2. The aerodynamics on the sun peak are pretty exceptional. As long as there isn't any turbulence from other vehicles, the visor stabilizes the helmet to give a nice smooth cut through the air, even at 80+ mph3. The modular system is easy to use. Pops open and locks shut effortlessly.4. The sun peak and visor are super easy to remove and install.\n",

      "The helmet is versatile, stylish, and flows a lot of air from the chin bar. The drop down amber visor is okay enough for both the morning and evening. The chin bar locks in place with a nice feel to it. I really want to like this helmet, but a couple of things prevent me from getting this again.- The helmet seems to be closer to long oval than intermediate oval. It definitely does feel like your cheeks are being squeezed in hard and even after the break in period, they're still sort of a pain. This doesn't happen for me for my other helmets that are listed as intermediate oval.- The top comfort liner has large gaps at the 1-2 o clock position and the 10-11 o clock position. My head is closer to a triangle than an oval and the rear top left and right \"corners\" of my head press onto the EPS foam because of this which hurt after an hour. They also happen to have edges in their EPS foam in these sections, probably to help with airflow but they just end up being a pain for me. I've worked around this, but I normally don't have to with other helmets that have more coverage on their comfort liners.- The drop down visor doesn't drop down low enough.If you fit this helmet well, then you'll probably like it a lot. I highly suggest wearing this around for two hours straight and see if you can tolerate it before going out on a ride in case you need to return it.\n",

      "I like the style of the helmet and fits really nice, easy to access/remove/clean the interior pads. I haven't tried it yet on the highway to check the noise levels. To save a couple of bucks I got the one with the dual-pane face shield (used for snow) which is not very clear, so I bought separately the clear one. The replacement it's super easy, and you can also remove the sun visor easily and fast.\n",

The Snow version has several differences and you should not buy it for using on motorcycle.The yellow sunvisor is not useful in sunny conditions. The Dual Lens doesn't really work as anti-fog. It fogged immediately I rolled out of garage on a rainy day and stayed foggy the entire 20mile ride.

In a few more days the screws holding the visor falls off, and they were on there pretty tight.

The helmet looks amazing. The features on the helmet are unmatched I dont think you can find another helmet with features like this. However please be aware that if you have a bluetooth it may take a little maneuvering and getting used to when attaching it to this helmet, also if you normally wear a large you may want to go up a size because mine fits great until I pull the full face down and it becomes to tight. All in all this is an awesome helmet for the price, just wish it would have come with bluetooth already attached because making mine fit has been difficult but it works and when I am on the phone know one can believe I am on my bike because the helmet seals out everything. The one draw back that I have had with this helmet is the visor fogs up really quick on cold days.\n",

      "On Clearance=great deal, MSRP=not such a great deal\n",
      "I picked up the black/chrome version on clearance for under $200, and at that price I am thrilled. Had I payed full price for it I may not be as happy, but would probably still be OK with the purchase.  Nice solid helmet with a great modular mechanism and the 180 degree flip back gives you a 3/4 option.  It seems pretty darn quiet to me.  Some wind noise when you get up over 60, but not too much.  I picked up the optional Linkin Ridepal 3 com unit, and with my earplugs in I get almost zero windnoise, but can hear the linkin loud and clear on phone, navigation, music, or even audible, which was something I could not say about my LS2 pioneer withheadphone jack connected speakers.Like most modular, it has the big fat jaw look.  I'm not really a fan of the look of the modular, but I tend to put function slightly ahead of form, so I am OK if I look a little silly if the helmet works well for me.  I got the black/chrome because it was deeply discounted on clearance.  Honestly not my style at all with the super flashy mirror chrome finish and black chin bar, but if you like a mirror chrome finish it is a nice one.  When my son saw me put it on he laughed an said I looked stupid, like some sort of super hero reject concept.  My wife said my head had a phallic look (but she used different less pg words and referred to me as captain ****head, as a follow on to my son's superhero comment).The venting is good.  The forehead vent doesn't seem to do a whole lot, but the chin vent is directed right up tight against the visor and does a great job of clearing fog and cooling your face.The 180 degree modular mechanism is brilliant.  Honestly top-notch.The integrate flip down visor is awesome.  I will never own another helmet without one.  As a matter of fact I was looking at dozens of other helmets I would have preferred over this one, but they didn't have the integrated flip down tinted visor and were disqualified for that.The optional Linkin Ride Pal 3 is slick as can be, easy install, great sound, and no one will even know it is there.Fit: this sucker is tight.  I'm hoping that it will be a little nicer fit once it is broken in.  RZ says it is intermediate oval in the video review, LS2 calls it long oval.  I have a head that is kinda in the middle between intermediate oval and intermediate round.  I measured in at 59cm, which should have put me in a large based on the sizing chart, but I opted for the XL based on my experience with the LS2 pioneer.  Even upsizing to an XL, this thing is really snug.  Any more snug and it would have had to be returned.  I'm hoping it loosens up once I have it broken in.  That said, it isn't a headshape mismatch, this thing is just undersized.  It is snug side to side and gives me some serious chipmunk cheeks, but it is also short front to back and my chin is just behind the chinbar, and it also feels a little short with my chin right down in the chin curtain.  Basically, it is a tight fit all the way around even though I upsized.i am happy with my purchase, but a big part of that is because I got it at a big discount.  This review and the rating provided are based on the price i paid, not the MSRP.  Had I paid MSRP it would have been rated a bit lower and I would have been much more critical.\n",

I love how it converts to open-face even though I always ride with it full-face because it's so easy to get on/off and it's nice when not riding to have it open for airflow. The built-in sun visor works great and covers my field of vision better than I expected it to. The only thing is that I wish it had more air flow through the vents, but again I don't know how this compares to other helmets since this is my first one - for all I know it has a normal amount of air flow.

I’ve had other modular helmets, but none that was as versatile as this or as easy to use.  The main shield and inner sun shield work great as well.  The stylish helmet design and awesome color are just a bonus.  I have black chrome, which is hard to describe, as I have never seem anything like it to compare to.

      "Before I purchased this helmet, I've done a lot of research first. I owned my gmax helmet for at least 6 years, before upgrading. I watched RevZilla's review on YouTube about this helmet and everything... Heard nothing but great things. I tried the helmet on at my local motorcycle shop and made sure the fitting was perfect before making the purchase. The only issue was the cost. I think the helmet is $399 plus online. I saw the sale on RevZilla for $199. Never dropped 200 so fast in my life. Fit:I normally rock a large, but for this I had to go up to XL. The helmet is very comfortable. Not too big, not too small. At first, I had to break in the cheek pads because they were squeezing my face. But now, perfect.Shape:The shape is more round oval, which is fine by me.Weight:I don't feed into the weight of the helmet. If you're worried about a few ounces of a helmet, you should put on a pillow case instead. It simply feels like a helmet to me.Vision:The vision is almost too wide. It's perfect. At times I had to touch the shield to see if it was there.Noise Level: Once you go above 60, every helmet is loud. Plus I always keep ear buds in while riding.Over all, great helmet for the price. I recommend you catch it on sale like I did.\n",

Really wanna get into the throttle and hit the curves, flip the mask back and there's a good field of vision. Air flows well through the vents. Nice sun visor, very nice all around. It's loud but to be expected with the mask the way it is. Not an unbearable noise level. Chin guard is a little too close... I have to push the helmet as far forward as I can so my chin doesn't rub.

Time will tell how this helmet works out. I do like all the features that come on this helmet for the lower price point.  It's decently quiet riding around with full face and visor down 3/4 to full,  only been up to 50mph about so far. Riding in In the 3/4 helmet mode, plus visor up,  it is fairly noisy with the extra open space catching the wind.\n",

      "Interesting shape, recommended, mind the snaps\n",
      "I like the way this fits me better than the similar (original) Shark helmet I replaced - too bad there aren't more options from which to choose. Revzilla's video describes this helmet as an intermediate oval, other sites describe it as a long oval, and on the phone Revzilla told me it's actually somewhere in between, which seems to make sense with my head. This fits me well so long as I remove one of the chin strap sleeves and turn the second one around so that I still get under-chin comfort without having the snaps press against my jaw. This means I probably won't be able to put bluetooth in the strap the way it was meant to be used, but as designed the snaps created a painful pressure point against my jaw, which went away once I figured out and solved for the problem. Could be that someone with a longer oval head than mine will be fine without the modification. In any case, I would definitely buy this helmet again among the options currently available, and I'll just use a different bluetooth/mounting option. Helmet provides a great field of view, and the conversion between full and 3/4 coverage works with one hand. Shape of the helmet does a better job against the wind, even when I turn my head to either side. Wish the pinlock anti-fog insert came with this, and I can't seem to find it in-stock in the U.S.\n",

      "I didn't wind up keeping this helmet, because it was a little short front-to-back. I think my melon is in-between Intermediate- and Long-Oval. The chin bar was a little too close to my chin, and I got a little pressure point on my forehead.Styling is nice - the black chrome looks awesome!Having the ability to move the chin bar all the way to the back of the helmet, resulting in a 3/4 helmet, is AWESOME! I was really looking forward to this flexibility. The only other helmet that I know of that does this is the Shark, and it's a Round-Oval shape, so won't work for me.Craftsmanship seemed great, optics were very clear, and I would have kept this helmet if the chin bar wasn't too close to my face. It seemed as if the chin bar rolled back under my chin a little too early, so my chin was too close to it for my preference.Kudos to RevZilla for free shipping, easy returns, and only charging me $7 to return a helmet.

And this LS2 can absolutely keep up with this $800 helmet!I love the fact that I can ride with the chin guard opened and still have the clear visor down..Before it was sun visor down only if my Schubert was opened.I can not really tell you about the noise since I have a very touring windshield which makes everything quiet for me but this helmet feels very light and very wide vision.The material they used for the inside feels comfortable too. I got my brand new one stolen after 3 days....and I just reordered the exact same one.\n",

      "I have done over 3000 miles since I got this helmet. I love the design and find it very comfy and with a very nice fit and finish. I managed to even mount an existing Sena 20S system to it. One small gripe is the low brow field of vision to the point where I have to tilt my head up to see overhead traffic lights. The only disappointment is the ventilation that I really find sub-par and I resorted to riding with the visor cracked open in 80+ temps.\n",

      "Great Helmet, but not for Everyone\n",
      "This helmet has been so far an overall great lid. Although it is on the heavier side, I can barely notice it when riding 6+ hour days. It deflects the wind very well, where my head is not bobbing around even at speeds of 90+ MPH. The vents actually do work on this helmet as opposed to the others that I own, so it is nice to feel some air on a hot CA day. The reason I say this helmet is not for everyone, is because wind noise and every day practicality will differ depending on what you ride, and your own personal size trait. I am 5'11, 32 inch waist, and ride a stock Ducat Multistrada 1260S. The wind noise level is very loud with this helmet on. In addition, the helmet does NOT fit the side OEM pannier of the bike, without first having to shimmy the helmet forcefully in. This is due to the large wind vent the helmet has.Although a great helmet, I could have overall gotten something a few hundred dollars cheaper that would have better fit my bike (figuratively and literally). So do some research heavy research first to see if this will be the case for you. Overall though, this helmet is worth the price point should it fit you and your bike!\n",

      "I've had this for a couple weeks now, and I LOVE this helmet. It is supremely comfortable, I have worn a GT-Air the last 6 years or so and that is a very comfortable helmet but this is more comfortable. The GT-Air fit me great, but if I jutted my chin forward I would contact the helmet - with the GT-Air I do not, so it appears to be slightly longer front to back. I find the Neotec 2 slightly quieter than the GT-Air as well. I have been looking at this helmet since it came out but didn't really love any of the color options - I'm glad I waited as I love this splicer graphic in orange, almost looks like it was custom painted to match my KTM Super Adventure!It is a fairly heavy helmet, but I honestly only notice that when carrying it - when wearing it, it is so well balanced and fits so well it feels no heavier than my GT-Air, in fact it feels slightly lighter in use because it slips thru the air better, I get even less buffeting than with the GT-Air (and that was fairly minimal).My only gripe is I got the integrated Sena unit, and I like it a lot (I have the 10U in my GT-Air and don't think I'll ever get a helmet without an integrated com unit available again) and while it's nice to not have to raise the visor to use the buttons, they are damn near IMPOSSIBLE to use with gloves on.This also is much easier on/off than the GT-Air as it slides right on or off with the face up, even thought it fits nice and snug.Bottom line: I couldn't be happier with this helmet, I love it. Super comfortable, quiet. looks awesome... sucks that it's $1,100 bucks for a lid (with the SENA), but I don't mind paying for premium gear for the fit and finish, features, and protection and this doesn't disappoint.\n",

I traditionally wear mediums but I went with a large based on revzilla's recommendation.  The helmet is one of the lightest I have owned (Shoei X-11 was lighter).  It is also the quietest I have owned.  It still has some wind noise but it is quieter than all of the other sport/racing helmets I have had.  The build quality appears excellent and time will tell.  I like that the sun visor can be adjusted to any position versus down and up like my Scorpion.  I also like the matte finish.  I have owned two HJCs in the past and the quality seems to have increased over those which were good helmets.  I'll need a little more time to truly judge durability of the helmet.  I hope to not ever test the protection aspects of the helmet.\n",

      "I was looking for a second helmet to go with my recent new bike purchase. I found that the HJC RPHA 70 ST compared favorably feature for feature with my 2 year old Shoei GT-Air, so I thought I'd try it out knowing that I could return it if it didn't meet my expectations. From fit, feel, and finish this helmet is right up there with the \"premium\" brands. It has slightly more compact  exterior dimensions than the Shoei GT-Air I already own, but feels just as comfortable with ample space between my jaw and the chin bar on my intermediate oval shaped head. Weight is average, but feels lighter than the Shoei.Plush moisture wicking liner is removable for cleaning, air flow through the front, top and side vents is more than adequate, visor is crystal clear and Pinlock ready with an insert included, a nice bonus. An adjustable drop down sunshade is easily operated with your left thumb, and positioned along the bottom edge of the helmet. Bluetooth communication devices will integrate nicely too, with ample speaker pockets for most of the popular devices like the Sena I'm using.Overall, a great product with all the features and build quality of helmets costing twice as much. Hard to find in most shops since they usually only carry HJC's more budget friendly line, but I'm glad I found it here.\n",

The fit is perfect but at first I had some pressure points on my ears but that was fixed by removing the speaker pocket covers. The ventilation is awesome. The only thing I can really nag about is the slightly narrow visibility and the \"city mode\" for the visor is almost none existing. If you leave the visor slightly open it just closes as soon as you hit any kind of bump.  Overall it's an amazing helmet. The price is a little high, considering the the RPHA 11 is the same price, but worth it.\n",

      "A lot to like here, good for a round head\n",
      "Knowing how to measure your head is one thing. Knowing said head shape is another. I didn't really understand what my head shape was until I bought a Stetson last year and was shown by looking at the hat band what head shapes are. The simplest way to know is to look at your ball cap after you take it off your head. If it is perfectly round? Round head, more of an oval? Then you have a long oval. Somewhere in between? Intermediate oval. Put another way, if you wear a hat with a severely curved brim and it touches your forehead all the way across you have a long oval head. If you wear a flat brim because of your wide head and can't curve your bill because the brim sits off your forehead you have a more round head.Ok, so all that aside. If been wearing Icon helmets for the past few years. Measurements aside I was putting myself in 3XL helmets when my head measured in at an XL because of head shape. This is dangerous as the helmet isn't properly protecting my head! So I originally had an Alliance Dark, then an Airmada and finally an Aiframe Pro. The Aiframe Pro never fit quite right and it being a long oval was downright uncomfortable on long rides. As I've gotten older my riding has changed so when I went to replace the Airframe I started looking for an intermediate to round oval helmet. Round oval is mostly found in Arai's and some lower end lids. The HJC Cl-17 was recommended by a few people and it fit well but my head wasn't quite that round. I started looking at the Rpha 11 and then found a sport touring variant. With similar venting and a drop down shield it sounded to me like the perfect helmet.Fitment. Helmet fits tight but not too tight, comfortable. It's amazing what a proper fitting helmet has done for every part of my upper body gear. My old helmet fit too low on my head eating up my neck. I now have a helmet that shows a neck and makes my jacket much easier to close to block out cold air. I can more freely turn my head and roll my head around. This helmets seems to run a size smaller so I measure at an XL and bought a XXL because of this. Fits perfectly. Very happy!\n",

This HJC, on the otherhand, fits like a glove. I'd say its true to size, (i got a medium, usually i'm in between M & L) figuring in the breaking in too. The biggest (and only) issue with it so far has been the cheek pads, waayy too tight, i almost couldn't get it on or off. But i ordered thinner cheek pads, and its a little better, and hopefully those will break in. Its not a problem while its on, just getting it on/off as I said...other than that, helmet looks great, fully functional, comfy, and can't wait to try it out\n",

      "Ive owned a  Scorpion helmet and HJC. That is all I have to compare it to.  I purchased the White version of this helmet with racing stripe down the middle and ride on a CBR1000rr 2012.  Paid 599 and received the pinlock fog insert free.As far as sound goes, the helmet itself is quiet.  I can hear the vents when im racing down the road but otherwise it doesn't make as much noise as my other helmets.  You're still going to hear your loud exhaust pipes and road noise.   Its not a giant earplug that wraps around your head.  One thing I have noticed about this helmet is that my head does not bob around at high speeds.   I love that.  When I check the next lane it doesn't feel like my neck is going to snap back from the wind.   This is when I realized there was a difference in nice helmets.The inside of this is EXTREMELY comfortable.  The vents do work well compared to what I had.  I have put roughly 800 miles riding time in this helmet.  I have not gotten to ride in the cold yet so not to sure how the constant open rear vent will be.  But for now, thumbs up.The visor clicks into position very nicely.  Doesn't have any slop to it.I noticed some say they cannot see well when in a full tuck.  Not sure why.  I raced down the interstate at 146mph and could see everything just fine while hugging the tank.   Maybe im not tucking down as far as they are..I have read poor reviews over the Bluetooth system and don't know if I will buy it.  On the flip side, I have never had a helmet that was so easy to put on and off with Earbuds.  (I have the 1more quad driver with foam tips)  They don't even try and push out of place.I do wish it would have been cheaper....but then again I wish everything was cheaper.     So I give it 5 stars.\n",

      "First impressions:+ Really professional presentation from HJC, who I've always known to be more of the lower tier helmet brand. The box and nice carrying bag, were on par with Shoei & Arai+ Paint and finish quality of the helmet is excellent- Liner has a moderate chemical smell, but goes away after a couple outingsFit and Comfort: - Fit is VERY snug at first. I am typically an XL or L, but this XL fit very tightly at first+ After a few wears and heat cycles, the fit relaxes and it fits very glove-like+ No hot-spots so far- Double d-ring and chin strap are not the best quality in terms of finish, but the strap digs into my neck a bit if the strap pad is not positioned just rightRiding Performance: + Eye-port is very large for how sporty the helmet is; good peripheral visibility+ Z-lift at 100mph is not bad at all! Compared to my Shoei Qwest, it is much much better+ Air-flow is very good overall. I can absolutely feel the difference in flow over my scalp when the top intake and exhaust ports are open and closed+ Shield latch and seal are far and away better than the Shoei Qwest- Shield \"city\" mode detent is a joke...it does not stay open if I go over a moderate bump -- overall the detents are pretty weak + Internal tinted visor is about the perfect level of tint for me+/- Internal visor operation is smooth, but wish it had positive detents in the up and down positions+ Noise in the helmet is VERY well controlled, even with all of the big air flow elements on the surface. It's almost like a white noise machine+ Less high speed buffeting than my Shoei Qwest + My Sena 10S fits perfectly with the supplied clamp+ Awesome that it comes with pinlock shield and an insert at this price point Overall, the small amount of negatives are far outweighed by the function and styling of this helmet. So much value packed in to this helmet; totally worth it to pay extra for the Matte Black/Grey/Hi-Viz color scheme. If you are cross-shopping against the Shoei Qwest or GT-Air, in my opinion, this helmet is superior.\n",

I bought the Bullitt on an impulse while out of town, but it turned out a bit too round as well.I followed the X3000 since RevZilla first listed it as \"Coming Soon\" and, upon getting the email when it was finally in stock, immediately ordered it. I've been wearing it almost daily since May 2018, so here’s an in-depth, long-term review.Looks:It looks great, and feels high quality. The white paint is high-quality, and almost looks like enamel. The leather on the inside is real, and the sueded fabric has held up like new through sweaty hot, and cold rides. Wearing a MS, the helmet has a nice, low profile, and doesn’t give the bobble head look.Fit:Although listed as a long oval, I found it to be a true intermediate oval shape. The Bullitt, which I wore for months, is a bit round, leaves space at the sides of my crown, and has a hot spot around my forehead,. The Moto 3 is particularly long, and leaves a full index finger's width between the helmet and my forehead,. The X3000 fits just right, with even snugness all around the crown of my head. You won’t have any problems if you wear glasses. Mine fit easily, and there’s no heavy pinching, which causes the glasses to “hover” on your face, unlike many other helmets.The cheekpads initially felt quite dense, but  flattened out pretty quickly. Since they were already thin to begin with, I will need to order a thicker pair to compensate.The liner is thick and luxurious, and doesn’t feel minimalist, unlike other retro helmets. As a little detail, the helmet strap is short. While slightly difficult to fasten at first, this is great, and means there’s next to no slack when the strap is secured and snapped into place. I like this.Airflow and Noise:I've never worn a standard full face on a bike, and my first helmet was a Custom 500. I also thoroughly enjoy the wind in my face, and ran the Bullitt without the shield in the summer. The airflow through the bottom of the chin is moderate. In summer, it isn't quite enough to stay entirely cool, but is absolutely adequate. It is enough that I will need to use some protection once winter hits.The forehead vent doesn't always work. I'm not sure why, and have tried angling the helmet on my head differently, but the vent sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't. When it really works, it REALLY works, and feels like a nice, steady blast of air over the top of my head. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work. As far as keeping track of the little plastic insert when opening the vent, there is a nice little sleeve on the side of the leather that you can stow it in. It will not fall out accidentally.Noise is average. There is noticeable dampening, without the feeling of having your head in a bubble, unlike standard full faces. I like being able to hear things, and simply wear ear plugs when I’m going to be on the interstate for more than 30-45 minutes. I would rather have this choice than a helmet that makes it difficult to hear things, and further disconnects me from the environment.Criticisms:I absolutely love this helmet, but there are certain things I wish were different. This is the only reason I haven’t given it five stars.The first thing that I noticed when putting the helmet on, is lack of space in the ears. The helmet is skinny, and my averagely-sized ears touch the sides. This isn’t too bad in itself, but there is another issue compounding it. For some reason, the liner does not have a full cutaway around the ear area, so the top half of your ears come into contact with the liner. If you don’t put the helmet on right, this means the liner will squish down on your ears and bend them. Maybe this is staying true to the original X3000, but I think it needs to change. Because of these things, wearing wireless earbuds on long Interstate trips, on top of my glasses, means gradually unbearable ear pain.Lastly, a small nitpick, there is no neck pad in the back. The Bell Bullitt has a nice neck pad in the back of the helmet, which really contributes to comfort, and the feeling of a secure fit. I wish the X3000 had one too. If AVG ever offers a revised liner with a neck pad, and more cutaway at the ears, I would buy it in a heartbeat. With an already ample and cushy liner, the addition of a neck pad would make it absolutely comfy.Overall:I love this helmet. Beyond a couple of nitpicks, it’s a fantastic helmet, and the retro full face I was waiting for. If AVG revises the liner a bit, and makes a version without the face shield, they will have created the perfect retro full face offering.\n",

      "Excellent modular helmet overall\n",
      "I decided to purchase this helmet based on favorable reviews that gave it good ratings for comfort, function, design, aesthetics, ample ventilation, and, most importantly, low wind noise. This helmet does not disappoint in all of the listed categories with the following caveats:This is the quietest modular helmet that I have worn so far, however, there is some elevation of wind noise that seems to be caused by turbulence related to the drop-down sun visor slide mechanism. There was also an increase of wind noise after the installation of a N-Com Bluetooth system. I ordered a medium size based on the sizing method listed by Nolan. Overall, the helmet fits perfectly, however, the cheek pads squeeze my cheeks making it somewhat uncomfortable in that area. I believe that is because of my head being extremely round and I think that it will become more comfortable as the pads break in over time. The ventilation is more than adequate so far, however the top vent mechanism is difficult to slide while riding and wearing gloves. I’m hoping that it will get less difficult to slide with use. The ample chin curtain is definitely a plus and does a good job, however, due to clearance issues, it conflicts with the boom miic. When attempting to close the chin guard it catches the boom mic making it difficult to completely close without manipulation of the mic and curtain. I do not regret the purchase of this helmet and I would definitely recommend it.\n",

      "Short version - I really like this helmet. This was my first purchase from Revzilla and I'm very happy with the service. Long Version. I have to say I don't have a lot to compare it to. I've only been riding about 10 years and my first two helmets were bargain basement specials whose only redeeming feature was the DOT sticker. However the last 7 years I have been using a Shoei Qwest so I can give a good comparison to that. The shape of the Nolan fits my head a little better than the more rounded shape of the Qwest which allowed me to go down to a Medium size while I had to have Large on the Qwest. The first couple of years the Qwest was very quiet but then as the liner began to compress it got noisier. Last couple of years were really loud. The Nolan seems even less noisy than I remember the Qwest being when new but in any case it is a very quiet helmet. I'm on a BMW RT so there is not a lot of wind for it to deal with.The Large Qwest with a Sena SMH5 attached weighs 64 oz. The Medium Nolan with the NCom installed weighs 65 oz. At 64 oz the Qwest was comfortable for 16 hour days so I expect the same from the Nolan.Pinlock works great. I've had several rides in cold wet weather and there were no issues with fogging.The only complaint I have and the reason for four stars instead of 5 is the visor release mechanism. What I terrible contraption. I kept thinking I would get better at it after taking it on and off a few times but that never happened. Now that the pinlock and bluetooth are installed my plan is to not touch the darn thing again unless it needs replacing.I have not had a chance to test the sunshield yet Haven't seen the sun in East Texas for a while. Mechanically it seems fine and I expect it to to do what it is supposed to but I just have not had occasion to use it.I got the Nolan for the modular feature and I'm glad I did. It's nice not to have to do the eyeglass dance when taking off or putting on the helmet and I'm sure I'll find lots of other advantages on long trips.\n",

      "I wanted to replace a 5 year old, Xspeed, inexpensive modular helmet with something that felt like a premium quality helmet without breaking the bank for a Shoei or Shuberth. I looked at Nolans at a dealer and liked what I saw so jumped onboard and pre-ordered this N100-5. I've been riding with it for about 2 weeks and 300 miles so far.I'm very pleased. The fit was on the money for what the fit guide called for. The helmet is much quieter than my previous one though I still use earplugs. It is quite smooth on the outside and the vents don't stick up in the airflow causing noise. The vents seem to flow air nicely though summer hasn't arrived in force but so far I am pleased with the airflow. I like the PinLock inner shield feature.I am used to having D-rings for the chin strap so the ratchet mechanism is new to me and I wish it were a couple clicks longer to fit under my fat chin. Also, without a D-Ring, I can't use my cable to secure my helmet to my luggage rack which is a minor annoyance. Because of the way the chin bar opens, the shield must be closed when the chin bar is up so I can't carry the helmet by the chin bar unless pulled into the closed position. That's not a fault, it's just different.The sun shield deploys easily and retracts just as quickly, once my fingers were retrained to the button locations. The adjusters for the collar roll probably won't be used and they get in the way a little bit but don't affect using the helmet at all.Overall, I am highly pleased with this helmet. It seems to have the quality and premium feel I was seeking. It is very comfortable even for 2+ hour rides so far. I am probably going to add a communication system to the helmet soon but haven't picked a brand or model yet.\n",

As an already great mid-range option, the lo-range price makes it all the more attractive.Let me say this: the venting is spectacular ! It is not absolutely quiet, but that's the gamut you run between noise and AIR! For the 95+degree temps I have been riding in this summer, I have not come across better venting unless you wear an open face with goggles.Comfort is great. Padding is very nice and the inner materials are super soft. View is great, with a nice wide field of vision that feels unobscured. I got the blue iridium shield and it POPS against the white helmet; very nice indeed. The drop down sun visor is a very nice feature and I have used it quite a bit. One thing I will say about it though, at least on mine, I am not so sure the inner sun visor is optically correct as there appears to be a slight warping in the center with some definite lensing/doubling of light sources in low light conditions. Not sure if this affects all or if it's just mine. Also, I just installed my Cardo Packtalk Bold, fits great and works great inside.Very happy overall!\n",

      "I have had a number of helmets over the years as I ride both sport and dirt bikes.  I have had HJC, Fox, and my last helmet was an LS2.  My LS2 got me hooked on the ratchet chin strap. And this was the only helmet that had a ratchet strap, internal sun visor, and blue styling.  In all honesty those were the only features I was looking for.  But the addition of the anti fog pinlock, vents that actually work properly, and the superior safety testing of the helmet definitely make it the best one that I have ever owned.  As for noise level, I usually ride with headphones in as I use a scala rider paktalk to talk to friends/girlfriend and listen to music.  This helmet is so quiet I can hear my music better.  I already had the scala rider comm and did not plan to spend another $300 on the Sena because I did not want to lose the ability to talk to my girlfriend.  I ended up fitting my scala rider comm on the left side and the back storage space worked well for hiding the headphone wires. There was no issue running the mic cable up front and tucking the wires behind the liners. I am very happy with the $700 purchase.\n",

      "Let me start by saying that I really do like the helmet.  I do have issue with one thing in particular.  The left cheek pad buttons keeps coming out of the cheek pad.  The first couple of days it was fine then this started to happen.  It's only on the left side.  I like the built in channels for my eye glasses and I like how quickly the wind screens change out.  I love how well this helmet vents even with the wind screen fully closed. Its lighter than my previous ICON helmet and the field of view is VERY wide.  If I could just get those darn buttons to stay in the cheek pads.  I got caught out at night with my tinted wind screen and it was not so dark that i couldn't see.  Overall I highly recommend this helmet even with the faulty cheek pad buttons.  Thanks again Revzilla!!\n",

      "Been using since March. It’s an easy opening modular helmet with DOT and ECE ratings. Retractable sunshade is nice, but you still have to wear sunglasses. Front vent works. Rear spoiler vent doesn’t. Pinlock insert works ok. It’s loud. Choker chin strap is bearable.  Sizing seems ok. Carbon sounded good but the weight is just ok. It’s not $800 light weight. And that is the biggest gripe. It’s too pricey for missing so many marks. If you want to spend a lot and have low expectations, then this is your helmet. It’s not what you would expect from AGV. Wish I had bought from Revzila so I could return it. Save your money and buy a better helmet for half the price.\n",

      "I am replacing a Shuberth C3Pro, so the AGV has some big shoes to fill.First of all, as everyone else has noted, the chin strap... Come on AGV, WTF? it is a bit of a choker. But, if you keep it looser than normal. It's fine.Pros so far. Keep in mind I literally wore it for the first time today.So far:1. Love the field of vision. Very broad. Broader than my Shuberth.2. Air flow. Massive. I'm afraid of what it will feel like at 100 MPH, but you can ratchet down the chin vent so it only flows a little air.3. Light. Very light. My Shuberth feels like a lead ball in comparison.4. Looks great. Very sleek. Compared to the Shuberth, which looks... functional.5. Fits Ok so far. All helmets should be a little snug before breaking in. The only complaint it the cheek pads are firm. But others say this will break in and soften up. I hope.Cons:1. That weird button for the visor. Its a small target with gloves on. I'm not used to having to \"unlock\" the visor to lift it up. I may just remove the catch by removing the one screw on top. It should stay down on it's own. Just annoying...2. The sun visor. Seriously, where is this thing made? Don't they have sun there? Shipping with a light smoke visor is next to worthless. AGV should ship this with the Dark Smoke. I have to shell out $50.00 for what should have been included. Shame on you.3. The chin curtain is a bit weird. I felt some unusual buffeting on my my throat. It eventually went away. I'll play with it and see if it goes away. It doesn't fit as well as the Shuberth. 4. Massive airflow. Ok. I listed this as a pro, but here is the con. You know what it feels like to open your visor at 60 miles an hour? Yeah. The wide open chin vent feels like that. MASSIVE air flow. Here in Austin, I love it. But I feel like I'm choking on air.5. Noise. I have read it is \"as quiet\" as the Shuberth. So far, it isn't. My HJC was noisier. My Shuberth is quieter. But even the Shuberth needed ear plugs at higher speeds and longer distances. Did I mention how freekin light this thing is? :-)All things considered, I'll keep it. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. AGV, I hope you are listening. Oh. And 1 more thing. Revzilla, please educate your Gear Geeks. I called to ask for a darker sun visor. i was told by one Gear Geek that this helmet shipped with the darkest available. He was wrong. It ships with the lightest.\n",

      "I was worried about the chin strap the most since the negative reviews were mostly of the the chin strap being back to far and choking the riders. I don't have a problem with that at all. I have always had a full face helmet but as I'm getting older I wanted a modular. The chin bar must be up to put it on, but I can leave my glasses on. It could have more venting but then it would get louder. I would buy it again.\n",

      "It’s not perfect, and I’m somehow disappointed with some of its issues, but overall its positive aspects made me give it a 4 (clearly over 3, not 5)It’s the lightest modular helmet available. The helmet weight really matters when you’re riding for hours, and this one is REALLY light! It also happens to be a really good-looking modular helmet… maybe the best looking modular on the market. It fits well to my head and its interior is so far very comfortable.The drawbacks: first of all, the chin (throat) strap isn't great, I read many reviews mentioning this issue. While I agree with most of those reviews, it can be solved by loosening it to a not so tight position. Something that I found really annoying is that it doesn’t have a buckle… it comes with the old fashioned two rings system. It can take me way too much time just trying to adjust it properly, mainly if I'm wearing gloves. I think it’s a drawback for a 750 dollars helmet!The next issue is the neck roll. I read many reports mentioning the same issue. Every time I take the helmet off, the back of the neck roll is pulled out of the shell. It’s somehow annoying and makes it feel cheap, obviously not well done. This particular issue is quite in the limit of being unacceptable on a helmet this expensive.Another issue is that when the visor is open, its locking mechanism appears in the middle of your field of vision, which means there's a plastic latch that hangs down directly into your line of sight. It's distracting but you can survive!Would I recommend this helmet? Yes!It’s light (the lightest!), very comfortable, and good lookingOne would expect an overall better built and a more quiet helmet for 750 dollars but the positive attributes really matter…This is a 4!\n",

      "I really wanted to like this helmet. Unfortunately I was one of those people who found the chin strap mounted too far back to be comfortable. I wanted to add a quick release buckle to the chin strap but that made the problem even worse, the buckle would smash against my adams apple when I turned my head. The fit and finish was great, and I loved how light the helmet was, the chin strap was a deal breaker for me though. Also the description for this helmet mentions that it's compatible with glasses, but I did not find that to be true. The padding at the temples didn't have any kind of recess for eye glasses, it just compressed slightly around the arms.\n",

      "Beautiful design, incredibly light, bad chin strap position\n",
      "The quick summary for those that don't want to read a novel:1) Beautiful styling2) Light - and I mean LIGHT... 3) Comfortable fit on the head4) Well-built, actuation and quality seem top notch5) Chin strap position choked me until I tapped out... 6) Really disappointed - it's a great helmet and I really wanted to love it. I gave it a 4 because I think the helmet is great... but the fit of the chin strap is a complaint others have made, so it's not just me... otherwise a 5 star keeper.As some other reviewers have said, \"I REALLY wanted to love and use this helmet...\" But, I have to be honest, the positioning of the chin strap was a persistent pressure on my throat / larynx. But, I'll get back to that... let's start with the good... because this helmet could work for you, even if it didn't work for me.I've had a lot of helmets, including AGV's in the past. It's hard to beat the Italian styling - but after cycling through many different helmets, I settled on my staple, the Shoei RF-1200. It fits me well, is sorta quiet, very safe, not over the top expensive... and heavy. On a long trip, the RF-1200 is fine - I don't mind the weight really. But, for around town, I get REALLY tired of taking off my helmet at every stop, so I thought a modular helmet would work. (FYI - this big idiot, me, actually walked into my bank one day with my helmet on... I was taking it off as I walked in, which probably saved me from a \"tazer\" experience...)  Anyway, this is why I wanted a modular helmet. Modular helmets - and in my opinion, especially the Schuberth models, are bulky, unattractive, and heavy. So, the AGV SportModular seemed like a good option, even with the $750 price tag (I bought the white version). It is LIGHT... it was light in the box. Really light. if that's important to you - this may be your helmet. It's lighter than my RF-1200 and by a lot - noticeably. The helmet - again in my opinion, is beautiful. Really nice lines and a great looking piece of kit. And, in person, it was just a nice looking. Relative to my RF-1200, the large AGV was a bit wider, but not objectionable in any way. The fit on my head was very comfortable - more so than my Shoei and previous AGV helmets. The view-port with or without the visor is tall enough, and probably wide enough... but I really noticed the chin bar and sides of the helmet in my peripheral vision. It was noticeable enough to me that I kept putting my Shoei on to see if I could see the same. Honestly, it's in the Shoei RF-1200 also, but for some reason it seemed less noticeable. I think it has to do with the slightly wider helmet making it far enough away from the eye that it stands out more. When flipping up the visor, I did notice the locking mechanism at the top of my view... don't care... did not bother me at all.The mechanism for opening up the visor (lock) was easy for me to actuate, even with a gloved hand. The chin-bar mechanism was GREAT to open... very easy... just reach up and actuate the lever and flip it open. It snicks snugly into place without issue. It comes down just as easily - although I had to adjust my hand position as it wouldn't lock into position with my finger on the lever (duh... stupid, stupid)... but, with that change, the helmet locks down great. Accessing the vents was no problem, and the interior visor moves up and down easily with the left-side mounted actuator. I will say that when the helmet arrived, the internal visor was loose and I had to reinstall it. It was easy and worked fine, but I noticed that it wasn't the best part of the helmet. For me, I don't ever use them - I wear sunglasses under the visor, and often even under a dark smoke visor (sun sensitive eyes). So, I might have taken the interior visor out entirely.As soon as I put the helmet on and fastened the chin strap, I started to get nervous. On close inspection, I think that the interior attachment points for the chin strap are too far to the rear of the helmet by just a couple of millimeters or possibly they need to be rotated slightly forward so that the strap doesn't emerge straight down. Regardless, I wore the helmet around for hours and loved everything about it, except for the chin strap. I loosened it up to a point that would probably not be very safe and it still rested against my larynx. In a riding position, with my chin slightly tucked, it was worse. I know that if it was bothering me around the house or sitting on the motorcycle for a few minutes, that after 7 hours of riding on a long day, I would be cursing it, which is really too bad for such an otherwise great helmet. By the way, I am NOT overweight nor do I have a big neck / throat. 6 feet tall and 170 pounds. It's the helmet.\n",

      "Is this helmet worth $750?\n",
      "This is a great top quality helmet and the only question is whether it is worth the $750 price tag. I have about 1500 miles in this AGV, and the baseline for this review is my prior helmet, a Schuberth S2 which I used for over 25,000 miles.The S2 is also a high quality helmet, and it is marketed as a very quiet and stable helmet. The first thing I noticed at highway speed is how incredibly stable the AGV is; much less buffeting and effort than I was used to. I can ride comfortably at highway speed with the motorcycle wind screen in the lowest sport bike position (Kawasaki Concours 14). I don’t think this helmet is quiet. My old Icon Airmada is quieter than either of these high-end helmets. I definitely still need earplugs in the AGV.  Of course the AGV is extremely light, 4-6 ounces lighter than the S2, and that is why I chose it.  Perhaps that makes it less susceptible to wind buffeting. Ventilation is good but not great. There is a spoiler at the back of the AGV that you can open to expose exit vents, but I did not notice any difference with it open or closed. The lining is reversible for cooler/warmer weather, and the difference is noticeable. The AGV visor is awesome; great quality, easy to use, easy to remove, pinlock included, and has 2 locked positions (closed and cracked). The detents are soft, however, and the visor will not stay open above about 40 mph which might annoy some people. The AGV internal sunvisor is good, but not as good as the S2; its mechanism is lower quality, and it comes with a (too) light smoke tint. The shell in a size Large is slightly bigger than the S2, but not bobble-head looking (the AGV shell is smaller than the Icon Airmada. I have a 59.5 cm head and the size Large fits perfectly. The carbon fiber pattern on the shell has one noticable cosmetic flaw, but that does not bother me. I was not in the market for the modular feature, but it works perfectly. It is a nice option to have and it allows for a very snug fit around the neck roll. As mentioned in other reviews, the neck strap is positioned noticeably father back and closer to the throat, but it is not uncomfortable for me so long as I don’t cinch it very tight.Any helmet is going to have some quirks and imperfections. In my opinion the weight, shell design, and modular design are what make this AGV better than any other touring helmet on the market. But is it worth $750? It is for me!\n",

I think my love for the slim pack talk and how loud this helmet is are the only big downsides for me. The padding does easily come loose over time, but I am careful when putting the helmet on/off and this seems to help. Field of vision and modular capability is the best. Airflow is decent, with easy to use vents.\n",

      "Absolutely devastated that I have to return this beautiful piece of junk\n",
      "I really, REALLY wanted to like and keep this helmet, but some pretty glaring issues are just too hard to overlook on a $750 lid.First of all, this IS the lightest modular helmet available. It also happens to easily be the best looking modular helmet on the market. That's why its so heartbreaking to have to return.First of all, the chin (throat) strap isn't great, but it's not as bad as I was expecting it to be. It is far back, but as long as I didn't tighten it too much it didn't both me, your mileage may vary.Where my main issues come in is the visor and the neck roll. The visor has to be the worst designed thing to ever grace a helmet. When its all the way down, it locks in, and you have to press in a small, awkward button while pulling it up to release it. This thing is hard enough to find let alone operate with gloves on. The next issue with the visor is that aforementioned locking mechanism means there's a plastic latch that hangs down directly into your line of sight. The visor doesn't open tall enough, so you'll never not see the latch. It's very distracting and feels like someones dangling a carrot in front of my face or something.You can unscrew and remove the latch, which I did immediately, but then you completely lose the smallest open visor position because the latch keeps it open when up against the locking mechanism. Seriously? Why wouldn't that just be built into the same main mechanism as the rest of the detents are, rather than relying on this stupid lock or keep it propped open? Without that horrible latch installed, there's just no way to crack the visor open just a little bit, which is how I usually ride. Venting is pretty good, so if you don't live in a hot climate like I do you might not care as much about being able to crack open the visor.The next big issue is the neck roll, and I'm not sure if this is a QC issue but there are plenty of reports confirming my problem. Each and every time you take the helmet off or on, the back of the neck roll is pulled out of the shell. It comes out so easily, that just tugging on the chin straps to widen the shell a little bit pops it right out. It's just not held in securely by the 2 small plastic rings that clip into the shell, and makes the whole thing feel remarkably cheap and shoddy, and is frankly unacceptable on a helmet this expensive. I get that compromises must be made in order to keep weight down but there's really no excuse for this. Seems like it could easily be fixed with a better molded plastic connection point on the neck roll.Would I recommend this helmet? No I would not. It ticked all the boxes I desperately needed and was willing to pay extra for, but the poorly designed visor and the remarkably cheap and annoying liner issues completely ruin it for me. Perhaps the next iteration of this helmet will fix these faults, and I'll reconsider it then.\n",

      "The specifications, quality, light weight and decent reviews drew me to this helmet.Out of the box I was real excited about this helmet, but when I put it on and strapped it to by head things changed. The straps were tight and made contact back below my jaw and pressed tightly on my neck. I tried desperately to move the strap and readjust the position so I could keep the helmet - no luck. After wearing it for about 10 minutes it was a huge relief to unbuckle and remove it from my head. I cant imagine riding in this helmet. It is more sport oriented and perhaps I am not used to that type of fit. My current Shoei Neotec fits perfectly, but compared to the AGV it is heavy and I really wanted to get a light weight helmet. Also tried the Klim Carbon fiber helmet, but for me the fit wasn't quite right. I had no choice but to return the AGV and order the Shoei Neotec 2, hope it fits as well as my current (aging) Sheoi Neotec.\n",

I decided to wear it around the house and break it in for a bit to be sure. I'm glad I did. The padding compressed just enough that I am completely comfortable in this helmet now. It really is unbelievable how light it is. After some research online, I decided my chin being so close to the chinbar wasn't the end of the world and I'm getting used to it.

The attention to detail on the interior was very impressive as well, quality materials make the helmet feel amazingly comfortable while riding, having the reversible crown pad was a HUGE!!! plus for me as i ride in many different climates sometimes hot and sometimes cold. To top it all off the helmet (for being a modular) is absolutely beautiful, considering most modular helmets look big and cumbersome. I've had a few friends of mine not even realize it was a modular until i opened the the front of the helmet. I am over all very satisfied with the helmet and would recommend it to anyone looking for a modular helmet.\n",

      "This is my second helmet. First helmet was an LS2 Stream. The HJC was a bit more expensive, but was worth it. The fit is much better than the LS2, the gasket and visor are better quality, and it comfier. My only issues with the helmet is the lousy chin curtain that is sold seperately and it doesn't really stay in after installed. I would also recommend purchasing the PinLock insert because the antifog coating is not that great. The PinLock insert is amazing! The noise in the helmet is what is expected. I use earplugs so I'm not too bothered by it. HJC is an amazing brand with quality products.\n",

      "This helmet is great! I bought it because of the slide down visor, and I’ll be honest the first ride with it I did not like it. There is about a centimeter gap between the shaded visor and the helmet, and at first it was too distracting for a first time rider. Fast forward two weeks... I don’t think I have ridden without the shaded visor down! I love it! The only thing I don’t like is that the cheek pads are a little tight on me, but probably still need to break in.\n",

      "Preface my review at start saying this is my first full face helmet, so getting use to it. Second time out noticed a rattle.  When I examined helmet noticed the upper top left air vent was not functioning and loose.  I pressed down firmly on it and it seemed to snap back into place on the inside tab and it began to work properly again. Have notified Revzilla, stating I was alright keeping the helmet if the vent tab does not become a recurring issue. The Revzilla rep.told me has made note of my complaint and to contact them again if issue continues.  Other than that (and why the four star rating), paint, pads, shield, etc., function and appear to be quality made.  Again, first time owning full face and expected the noise to be less and thought the airflow would be more, but may be typical of these helmets.\n",

      "I've always bought HJC helmets in full face or open face over the past several years because of my own experience combined with their reputation for quality. This i 70 replaces my CL-17 which was a round oval and pressed against my forehead. The size chart from HJC is not true for me because it says I take a size L when the size XL fits much better: snug and not pressing in any singular area. This is the best fitting one I've owned, the air flow is better than any in the past full-faced helmets, the vision is better and the icing on the cake is not only can I put my eyeglasses on and off easily, the drop-down sunshield clears them with room to spare. I don't have any comments on the outside looks because I really don't care, my view is from the inside and I can wear this helmet all day in hot or cool (I don't ride below 50 degrees.) weather in complete comfort. I highly recommend this model, especially if you wear prescription glasses.\n",

The safety, price and comfort for my head shape were the main reasons I came back for another.  That said, there are a couple issues and I don't know that i'd come back a second time:On my first one, the AirFit system didn't last 6 months before the air pocket got a leak and would just deflate again if I ever tried to use it, so I consider it a gimmick on a helmet meant to last 5 yearsOn my new helmet, the insides seem to be rotated by a few degrees relative to the outer shell.  The shift is enough that my nose doesn't line up behind the nose guard.  I don't think this level of misalignment is common, but it does bug me every time I put my helmet on.\n",

      "I've had this helmet for a few months now, have put almost 1.5k miles on my bike while wearing it, and have a few findings to share. I will say right off that this is my first helmet, and so some of my statements come with the caveat that I have nothing to compare this helmet to. TL;DR: Overall, the helmet inspires confidence were I ever to go down and the helmet is comfortable enough, but it's the little things that remind me that this helmet is a budget/mid-range track day helmet. Fitment/ComfortFitment went about as expected, as Andy said fit was a bit tight. Being right on the upper edge of a Large according to the size chart, I went XL and it fit snugly, with the following notes: - It's a bit tight in the cheeks (even without puffing up the AirFit system), but nothing too uncomfortable. I have noticed myself riding with my mouth dangling open to avoid compression from the cheek pads, which worries me (when I notice it) since that could be bad news for my tongue if something happens. - I have noticed that there's a pressure point on the forehead after about 30-40 minutes of riding. - Space near the ears is *very* limited. There's *definitely* no room for speakers (as others have mentioned), but I've noticed even trying to ride with ear buds in is pretty uncomfortable. AerodynamicsOverall, the aerodynamics of this helmet are decent. I ride a Sportster, and so I'm upright 95% of the time and the helmet does well, but I do notice that if I lean into the wind a bit that there's a little less resistance from the helmet. At highway speeds, things get a little hairy since my bike is pretty close to naked. Buffeting happens often, but I'm not sure that this is the helmets fault. Noise This helmet is certainly not the quietest. Especially with the top vents open, the wind noise is very noticeable, and more recently I've started to notice the occasional whistle coming from somewhere (I've switched the shield out quite a few times, mind you, so that could have something to do with it).The noise that gets through this helmet makes the lack of ear room especially disappointing. Face Shield(s) It's awesome that this helmet comes with the tinted shield (although I ended up picking up the mirrored one separately). However, both of the shields that come with the helmet have a strange effect to them when looking close to the sun where the light kind of ... crackles (?) across the shield and can be very distracting. The mirrored shield I picked up separately does not exhibit this effect. All of the shields fog up pretty easily in cool/damp weather, so I'll often need to leave the chin vent in the half-way position or the visor cracked to clear away fog. AirflowI only had a short time with this helmet during the warmer months, but I never had any issue with air flow. The chin vent lets in quite a lot of air, as do the upper vents. And if you really need an extra burst of fresh air, the cracked position of the visor *really* comes in handy!\n",

      "Long Ovals Rejoice- This helmet is one small fix from excellence\n",
      "The R2000 is a gem for long ovals. Only the signet-x has felt better on my head, though not by much. This is definitely a long oval friendly helmet.Quality I would call shoei-lite: very, very close. Weight is par for the course for the class nothing crazy. Shell is compact. Looks good. Interior materials great. The cheek pad inflation system works, whether or not people want to call it a gimmick it is effective. If you're interested read from this point til the end***. It's one fix is the top liner- it is very thin with essentially no padding. It almost seems like they forgot to put a pad there, because the helmet rides just a tad low. Another reviewer mentioned it was not bald friendly- well frankly it is rough on my full head of hair also. However, super easy fix. Normally I would be the kind of person to cringe at instructions to fix a shortcoming in a review, but stick with me here. I took a strip of the perforated foam padding that typically fills back/chest pockets in jackets, about 3/4 cm thick or so. Cut it to match the top liner, and slipped it above the liner. The liner has wings that you can fold around the foam to keep it in place.Voila. Not only is the one weakness gone, but the helmet rides just a tad higher (which it needed, rode a tad low at first- sorta missed my high cheek bones with the inflation too). Perfect comfort all the way around your long oval head, and the cheek pad inflation snugs to your cheek and jaw bones.Give it a shot. I think you will be impressed. My RF-1200 is 200% the cost and the scorpion is a bit better in my opinion, especially for long ovals.\n",

      "Right out the gate I will say that this helmet is cleaner than a machine picked chicken. Haven't been riding a week and I've already gotten three girls pregnant because of this thing. It was a little tight at first but after breaking it in I'd say it fits better than some well worn Cole Haans. There is a slight pressure point at the crown due to my pointy noggin but the adjustable cheek pads... at this price point... maaaan come on! Comes with a FREE tinted visor and I caution you when opening the air vents. One time I opened all the vents AND cracked the visor at the same time, oh yeah it has a pretty bodacious \"city mode\" to keep you from foggin, but I bout blew my eyelids off there was so much air flow (especially in a tuck). That was the same day I accidentally wore the helmet all day because it's so light I forgot it was there. When I realized I had worn the helmet all day and finally took it off I was surprised to find that I had grown a full beard thanks to this bad boy. Not only that, but I could also play the solo from free bird flawlessly... Do yourself a favor and get this guy now while it's on clearance so that you have more singles to throw while you're out with the boys. I went with white for visibility and decoratable-ness but if you want black then I won't judge your bad decisions. In all seriousness I have been very happy with my purchase so far and would definitely recommend this hemlet. It's not extremely comfortable/plush but it's not uncomfortable either and with all the features and the look of it in this price range I think this was a great buy for my first helmet. Hope this helps\n",

      "Excellent helmet. Glasses ok, but not speakers.\n",
      "Everything about this helmet is comfortable, even for long, hot days.The helmet is a little heavier than most, but the inflatable cheekpads let the helmet sit nicely along the jaw so that turning your head is effortless. The pads are quick and easy to inflate and deflate, and it allows you to customize the fit and to close off the space between the bottom sides of the helmet and your jaw.The helmet is a snug, narrow fit. It feels great as long as your head isn't super wide. It's a bit of a squeeze as you first put it on, but it's well worth it to have the support on your neck and jaw. It's not meant to be a quiet helmet (it's for the track, where earbuds are standard) but it manages to be surprisingly quiet because the neck support keeps the bottom of the helmet streamlined and acts as a barrier to road/engine noise from below. With the visor closed (and not cracked), it feels like you're wearing earplugs.Airflow is perfect. Nice breeze, even at 10 kph. You can also cut all the intake vents off and ride without air.There's enough space for your glasses, even big ones. There's lots of space between the eyes and the face shield, and the frames sit nicely atop your ears.Visors are easy to change after a brief practice session, and the ones that come with the helmet are excellent. The 'cracked' setting on the visor lock prevents against all but the most aggressive visor fog.Even the bag that the helmet and extra visor come in is very high quality.This helmet absolutely will NOT support your speakers. I don't care how slim they are or how handy you are with a dremel. There is simply no space, nor any easy way to make space, as the ear pocket spans all three foam support structures. The lowest of low-profile earbuds MAY work, but not the kind that routes a wire or piece of plastic along the top of your ear, because they'll get torn off your ears as you take the helmet off. I tried and failed with Shure SE215-K earbuds; just taking the helmet off was a bad time. Apple earbuds won't work either; they come out too easily.Interestingly, there's plenty of space to route wires between the dome and the head padding, but nowhere to put speakers.  ¯\\_(?)_/¯If you don't need speakers, this is an incredible helmet. It's a very low price for the features, comparable to a $600–$800 helmet, even in 2017.\n",

      "A helmet probably best for track use only\n",
      "This was the first helmet I purchased for my first motorcycle ever. Put simply, I should have done more research. The helmet is great. It isn't too heavy. I can see everything. As a helmet it definitely works, but it has its quirks.First off, if  you're using a comm system, this is a no go. I fitted my 20s speakers into it which caused my ears to always fold on the way in, and were always pressed against my ears, and this is with no comfort cover on the speakers.The helmet is very noisy at speed especially with the vents open, which do not provide an incredible amount of air, but I did like the ability to crack open the faceshield.Speaking of the faceshield, huge pro, the switching mechanism. It is not as simple as my newest helmet, but it is definitely a simple quick change (better with the clear than the dark visor). Depending on the thickness of your gloves, operating the visor locking mechanism/city driving lever isn't too hard. The faceshields themselves present another problem. This is my first helmet so I do not have much more experience, but they scratch really easily. They do not come with pinlock, and you have to purchase a separate visor for the pins, and the pinlock on top of that. That came out to another $70+, which was necessary for me during the winter. While the whole kwikfit system is a nice touch, I don't feel safe having to use the air pump to get a precise fit. I'd prefer to have cheekpads that fit tight at first and then loosen up to my face. I feel like if I were to face an actual impact that the airbags would pop thereby losing some of the \"false\" padding. Now on to my biggest gripe. I know you're not supposed to use a helmet after a fall, and sometimes even after the helmet by itself falls to the ground, but it seems like the shell isn't very protective if a simple fall from (not exaggerating) <2 feet (from my knee to concrete ground) can cause a crack. Like I said, this is my first helmet so I have not experienced such an accident with any other helmet, but I do not feel secure with a helmet that cracks from such a small height. In my opinion, this helmet would be best used for those short occasions when you go to a track. As far as commuting/riding is concerned, I do not recommend as there are far better options at the same price range, or a little bit more but with pinlock included.\n",

Definitely watch the video, Revzilla's videos on all their gear is what seals the deal for me. Helmet came exactly as I expected. Anthony states in the video that it is a more encompassing helmet; you feel super secure in it. I was a little worried at first because of how tight it was putting on (like being birthed again), but once it was on it felt fine. Took week or so for the cheek pads to break in and now it feels great. I don't utilize the air system because I have chubby-ish cheeks already.Definitely recommend this helmet, extra visor is a huge plus. I have the matte black and I use the dark visor. Removable Scorpion logo is also thoughtful. Easy to remove with a little heat. Comes with bags for extra visor and helmet itself.\n",

      "I bought the matte black version of this helmet a month ago to replace a 7 year old Scorpion EXO-700 helmet that desperately needed to be retired. I have 250 miles in this helmet and this review is based on that short timeframe.TL;DR - This is a great helmet if you need top of the line for track use. If you ride for fun on the weekends, save your money and get a sub $200 lid (EXO-710 or 410)Overview:This is a good helmet. Fits snug in the cheeks, but bedded in after one hour of use to the point that it was perfect. Really cool that it comes with smoked and clear windscreen. Lots of features, very comfortable. Tons of wind noise entering in by the ears where the visor attaches. Almost too much airflow inside the helmet even with the windscreen down. The chin skirt does almost nothing to keep air out. Visor will literally never fog up, which is great as I ride in temps into the 20's. I've only owned Scorpion helmets and I was really hoping for a huge improvement over my old EXO-700, but this feels pretty much the same. I was really looking for decreased wind noise, but guess I'll have to just start riding with earplugs.If you need a nice track helmet, this is a dream. If you need a helmet for a weekend ride or fair weather use, save $100 and get a lower-end model.\n",

      "I tried the Scorpion EXO R2000 and returned it. I wear a size XS and  the XS Scorpion EXO R2000 was way too large for me. The helmet was noisy, my Sena 10c speakers did not fit (pressed on and rubbed my ears) and I did not like the quality. The center forehead vent was raising up. The adhesive used was not strong enough to keep it held down. I realize the excessive noise could be that the helmet did not fit me correctly but.......It was loud.The EXO R2000 is a nice helmet despite my gripes with it. If the helmet had fit my head, if the center vent was securely fastened, if it were not so loud, if my comm unit fit,  it would have been a great helmet for me. I own a Shoei RF 1200 (size XS) and a HJC RPHA 11 Pro  (size XS) the Scorpion EXO R2000 does not compare well to either of them. But it's still a good helmet. Just not for me.\n",

Noise hasn't been an issue as of yet. The visor fogged up ever so slightly on my last ride, but that could have been because the humidity was up. Otherwise, vision is fine.

However, I am once again realizing that you get what you pay for. Air flow over the top of my head is poor. I noticed that the holes in the foam at my forehead are offset from the vent on the outside of the helmet. I thought this might be a manufacturing defect that reduced airflow so I called Scorpion. They said this was normal. The airflow over the top of my head is hardly noticeable and in the southern heat, I am truly uncomfortable on track. Also, there are pressure points on the back of my head just behind and above my ears. Thus, while this helmet appears to offer a lot of features for the money, I wouldn't recommend it to track riders.\n",

      "Had this for about a month now and, its pretty good. The only issue I have had is every time I ride for more then 30 minutes, when I get home and take it off I can't hear anything really for about 45 minutes because of the droning noise. Not a huge issue its just kind of loud for me.\n",

      "I was debating between Bell RS-1 and I decided to go with Exo-R2000 to save a bit of money and it seemed to have more features and I do not regret at all. I finally got to try this helmet on the street and I love it! It does feel a bit tight on my cheeks, but other than that, it fits well, and feels fairly comfortable. The airflow is amazing as I thought my shield was open when it was actually closed. It doesn't bother me at all while riding and has tons of features for its price. Also comes with a smoked shield, which makes the helmet look even better. It does seem to have a bigger shell than other Large size helmet, but still feels light and sturdy. Excellent packaging and excellent helmet overall. Highly recommended to anyone that likes to cruise and speed!\n",

      "Great helmet . Air fit cheek pad system is great. Surprised.\n",
      "I love this helmet. When I first got it and rode with all the vents open it was pretty loud. When you slightly tuck or ride a little less than full upright it is surprisingly quiet.After taking it on a 1500 mile trip I am very happy with this helmet. Nice weight , the main reason I bought this in addition to the price . I have had more than one neck injury so weight is a factor. As it breaks in and I figure out what the best combination of vents are , the noise is much more manageable. I ride behind a windshield almost all of the time.The features I like the most: The air-fit system for the cheek pads. I use this a lot. At higher speeds it really helps quiet down the helmet and to keep it rock steady on my head. No buffeting when I head check at all. The weight of the helmet. Comfort . The more I wear it the more I love it.I was really pleased with the quality of this helmet. Some of the scorpion helmets I have looked at were kind of junky but not this one. The EXO-R2000 is a top notch helmet. I like the way it is set up. Lots of cool features that you actually enjoy using. I know it is a race helmet but I toured on a trike with it and loved it. I have had Arai, Shoei, HJC, Nexx, and a couple of others. I think this is one of the best helmets I have ever had. I hope when I go to purchase another helmet in a few years these are still around. One more thing , the visor seals up tightly and does not leak water in the rain. The anti-fog works reasonably well. I wear glasses under the helmet so the glasses fog up more than the shield does. When going under freeway speeds I use the shield lock mechanism and raise the shield for city venting, anti fog and cooling off.All in all very happy with this helmet. Best helmet bag I have ever seen free with helmet. Dark visor with visor bag included with helmet. Well done Scorpion . Value , and an awesome helmet on one deal.Revzilla rocks as always. Got the helmet to me intact and undamaged in two days for very reasonable rates. So I could have it to go on my trip with.\n",

My Shark RSR was bulky and worn out and I sold my Shoei 1100 to my brother--I needed a new full face. The Shoei 1200 was an excellent, comfortable fit at the store, but the price wasnt. I basically got the same fit, same comfort, for a $100 less by getting the Scorpion...minus the stupid chin strap and thinner windshield. It does come with a tinted shield and shield bag though which was a nice bonus.\n",

      "I purchased this helmet to replace a DOT helmet after reading about SNELL certification. As a new rider, I want to be the safest as possible although not breaking the bank due to all the gear I must buy immediately. The Scorpion EXO-R420 looks great in person. The paint looks flawless, and offers a very aggressive street look which I liked while maintaining Hi-Viz that I preferred on my helmet.It breathes air very nicely with the twice adjustable front chip/mouth vents and one single vent on the top heading to a nice size exhaust vent. I've used this helmet only up to 88F and was sweating just a little bit. The vents definitely help, but to take advantage of the upper vent you should be tucked. You will most likely not feel it in lower speeds.The fit in the beginning was 50/50 for me. I wasn't necessarily feeling any 'hotspots' but just a little pressure which over the span of a week loosened up and it fits like a comfortable glove now. I also had to get used to the size of a SNELL rated shell(as also wearing an XL helmet lol :p). It felt a little heavy in the beginning but you are wearing something that is true and tested.One big thing for me was the ability to comfortably wear my prescription glasses. They have comfortable slots to slide your glasses in while wearing the helmet and with actually thickish frames they fit without pressure and I have ample amounts of room inside with the visor closed. I also did swap out the visor for the smoked visor.I would recommend this helmet to anyone again.\n",

      "This helmet is amazing.  I wear a small helmet, and this helmet shell is noticeably smaller than all of my other full face helmets.  Although I have one lighter helmet, the 1200 is Snell approved, so the 3 pounds 5 ounces is acceptable over the other, lighter helmet.  The real surprise came on the interstate at 80mph.  It doesn’t have nearly the drag as the others, and it’s quiet.  I could hear my motorcycle instead of wind.  Regardless, I wear ear plugs, but this helmet is the first of any that I’ve owned that I could hear the engine instead of wind.   Shoulder checks at high speed aren’t as jolting either.  Very nice.  It feels balanced and doesn’t have huge momentum when just looking around like my other full face helmets that sit on my small head like a mushroom.Sun glasses slide in and stick in place, but without any pain in the sides of the head.  They don’t ride up and down my face; they just sort of stick out, without resting on my nose though; they are firmly in.This helmet is distinctly more comfortable than the others.  It’s snug, without crushing, and cozy.  (The Shoei Quest wasn’t bad either, but the over all advantages weren’t that great. so I returned it.)It’s rather difficult to put on and take off.  Be prepared to have sore ears.  Wiggling it slowly helps prevent pain.One other thing about Shoei:  They don’t obsolete their stuff willy-nilly like so many knock-offs which means their over priced replacement parts are going to be around for many years to come, and that is less expensive and time consuming than trying to find another decent helmet.  And they’re very high quality parts.  The photo-chromatic shield will be next on my wish list once I have enough money saved up; no more need for sun glasses.I was very skeptical to buy this helmet after having returned a Shoei Quest, but it was worth it.  The engineering stands out.\n",

When trying on other helmets my jaw could or did touch the front of the helmet, or hang out. Not so with this one. Airflow is easy to adjust, and does just what you want it to. With chin curtain and little breath shield included, it leaves me little to want. I spent the extra to get a graphic other than a solid color, because hey, I’m gonna be seen in it a lot, and the finish is great and seamless. I honestly am not sure if I have a long oval or intermediate head shape, but my ears stick out a bit, and other helmets would press them into my head which would get uncomfortable on long rides. Not so with this one. So if you have a big chin, and your ears stick out a bit, this one might be your unicorn.\n",

      "A little off gassy at first (smelled like glue). However it fits perfectly and a few rides with all vents open and visor cracked the off gassing has passed and it's fine. At first I thought the chin strap padding was light and lacking, but I then as I was explaining this to a friend, it occurred to me on the ride down I did't even notice the chin strap. So though it might be light it is very comfortable. The vents are great, easy to control and nice and airy, but not too noisy. Overall the helmet is quiet, not wiser quiet but quiet. It also comes with the pin lock antifog lens. I have not installed it so cannot comment on that yet. Overall lovely helmet, fits snug and comfy, good vents, looks great, and it's a SNELL approved helmet. I'm very happy with it and would highly recommend it to anyone, just be prepared to air it out a little... unless you like that sniffing glue experience.\n",

      "Best 3/4 helmet available with a DOT and Snell rating\n",
      "I have worn 3/4 helmets all my life and enjoy the feeling of the wind in my face over a full-face design. This one provides a good, snug fit. Perhaps it is too snug around the cheeks out of the box and you really can’t wear sunglasses when you put it on or they will be on the ground when you do. Over time the padding has conformed a little to the contours of the face and does not feel so much like a grandmother is pinching my cheeks together and making me say, “Chubby baby.” All of the inside parts are detachable and washable, and in some cases customizable for size. Airflow and visibility are good. It’s a bit pricey for a 3/4 but you really shouldn’t put a price on protecting your head and I would most likely purchase one again. If you don’t like full-face designs then I would absolutely look at this as an alternative.\n",

      "I bought both Bell Custom 500 and Shoei RJ at the same time to try both out. By the way, RevZilla is the best in allowing purhases to be compared with its awesome return policy. The Bell was smaller in overall dimension. I think it looks better than the Shoei. But it is not comfortable. When I put on the Shoei, the inner liner felt so fluffy and soft and so comfortable. I was sold on the comfort alone. Of course the SNELL rating doesn’t hurt either. I think this is the only open face helmet that has SNELL rating. The downside is that this helmet does not feel much lighter compared to my Shoei RF-1200, a full face helmet. The overall dimension is quite big...somewhat of a mushroom head affect. However, the comfort level beats out all else. I have been using it for around 3 weeks now at the time of writing and I LOVE IT.\n",

Long story short, I like the helmet, but the visor thing killed my buzz with its buzz.  After, let's call it ?5k? miles, it loosened up enough that the noise was starting to drive me a little crazy. Not too bad on the Roadmaster with adjustable windscreen, but terrible on my Harley.  Further, it doesn't really flow air sufficiently at the top of your head.  Ended up going Arai (pricier) and a far more pleasurable experience.\n",

      "I did a lot of research before committing to make this purchase. I'm always reluctant to buy online. However, Revzilla's return policy assured me I wouldn't take a loss. The helmet fit true to the Shoei sizing chart. I'm still in the break-in stage but I really like it. The Harley ear speakers fit right in the holes. The helmet blocks the majority of the irritating ear wop and flap noise.  The music, turn by turn directions, and phone are easy to hear.  I ride a big cruiser with a large windshield so the ventilation system doesn't get the true air flow for cooling. However, I have leaned out and felt the wind rush through my hair through the vents.  I'd say they work as designed. In conclusion, I'm very happy with my choice of the Shoei RJ platinum R. Well made and great features. Does exactly what I hoped it would. I'm one of the rare breed of Harley riders who chooses to wear a helmet when the law allows otherwise. I like the look.  Great buy. Get one!\n",

      "Hey guys , received my new helmet from revzilla, and wanted to give my impressions. Shipping was fast as always and received the product without any problems. I followed the size chart supplied by shoei , and upon first trying on , I thought I had screwed up . The helmet is very snug putting it on because of the check pads and the lack of flexibility of the helmet. It is as they say in the video , very rigid for an open face helmet. However once on it is very comfortable. Took a little getting used to the cheekpads being as snug as they are , and I am still considering ordering some thinner check pads. Ventilation is much better than the Nolan n-44 I am replacing. I installed the sena 10s communications system and had plenty of room for speakers. Overall , very satisfied with the helmet. I have a 2009 gl-1800 in the dark cherry color , and the wine colored helmet matched it close enough for me! If you are on the fence , go for it , I think you will be pleased.\n",

It is also the lightest helmet I have ever purchased. The only con is the visor. It has a very bad tendency to lift the helmet, at speeds over 50 mph. I purchased this helmet because my full face helmets are hot in this 95 degree weather in Virginia. The three quarter design helped with that, and visibility is very good. I will try the helmet today, without the visor. As well made as the helmet is, I will definitely buy another, but in a different style. As always, Revzilla delivered promptly. Great service!\n",

Tried a full face and just did not like so i went with the Shoei 3/4 and glad i did, the helmet fits very well is nicely padded and gives me the feeling of safety over the 1/2 shell. It does flow air you can fell it over your head. You will sweat in 95% temps that's for sure if you are in traffic but on the open road it works very well.

      "I have this helmet for a couple of months now. Decided to get it an upgrade to my half helmet and get more ear protection while riding in a colder weather and on the long distance. The helmet is very well built. No doubts about quality of the construction and materials. The comfort of the helmet is great. I have an oval shape head and it fit's me perfectly. Matter of fact, while I had to get my other helmet in XXL size to fit me right, I'm very comfortable in size L in this helmet. Keep in mind however, that it has a fairly large shell. It is much larger in overall size than amy half helmet. The visor on this helmet is not helping me either. I have a windshield on a bike that is properly set up to end right below my eye level. The wind that is coming over the windowsill is getting caught in the visor and is trying to push your head back or sideways. Not such a great design idea. I'm gonna take the visor away, but it will impact the look of it. The noise protection is somewhat interesting. I have Rush pipes that are modestly loud. They sound way muffed trough the helmet. To the extend that the sound is not exiting anymore. That may be a feature of good noise cancellation. However, helmet adds some whispering wind noise on top of it that I totally did not expect. To conclude. Would I return the helmet? No. I'm going to use it as it does the job on most parts. Will I by it again? Most likely no. I would be looking for something of a smaller form factor and with more exiting design.\n",

      "I bought this helmet for the Quality of Shoei and the advantages of the 5 snaps.I added an $11 flat 5 snap shield to it to keep the bugs out. This is a much better value to me than the $40-60 proprietary face shields of the full face helmets. I can afford to replace it often when it gets scratched with in\\expensive face shields.I use this helmet on my Honda Wave in Thailand where the speed limit is 90 (KPH). I can buy at every motorcycle store in Thailand a 3 snap flip up replacement shield for less than $5. At that price I can afford to replace the shield when it gets a few scratches.I am old school at 65 years of age, and all of my first helmets were 5 snap open face models.

      "First of all, I purchased this helmet on a Wednesday night, it shipped Thursday and I received it Saturday...fast shipping!My first ride with it was the next day, we did about 250 miles and I never felt better. Keep in mind, I was wearing a half shell and 2 reasons I was wanting a 3/4 was for ventilation and to help cut wind noise in my ears. I got exactly that! The helmet was a little bigger than I was used to, but doesn't look weird or anything...besides, I don't care too much what I look like, I'm in it for the ride.Immediately after taking off, I noticed the air flow. What a difference that made. I used to be in a hurry to get my old helmet off when I got home because I would sweat so much in it. But this one is no problem. I'll leave it on while pumping gas and don't feel any different than if I weren't wearing a helmet...and I live in El Paso and the heat has been over a 100 degrees! So that should say something. I get home now and when I take my helmet off, my head is dry.Once I got on the highway, the noise control was much better than my half shell. I didn't have all of that wind rushing in my ears and I actually hear the music from my speakers a lot better.I was a little nervous purchasing a helmet online that I didn't have a chance to try on, but with Revzilla's exchange/return policy and exceptional customer service, I wasn't worried. Fortunately, based on the sizing chart, my head measured out to be right in the medium size so that's what I ordered, fit perfectly. The helmet is snug on my head without causing any hotspots or pain. Plus, riding on the highway, my head doesn't bobble around like it did with my half shell, so the aerodynamics on this helmet are top notch.I would definitely recommend this helmet to anybody!\n",

Minor gripe is how tall it sits on you hear and not a low profile as my Bell C -500 which super low profile, but again just an astetics call. The helmet does a great job of keeping out a good amount of road noise while still allowing to here what going on around you and my stereo.

      "I'm pleased with my selection of this Shoei RJ Platinum helmet for a few reasons. Number one is the overall comfort of the product as well as the fit and finish. I prefer a 3/4 helmet for the level of protection it provides. The volume of air flow through the top of helmet is adequate to maintain a cool head in warm weather. The D ring chin strap design.is easy to secure and release. Overall the product is superb and would recommend it to others on those long cruising rides.\n",

      "Holy comfortable helmet!!!\n",
      "For background, I own an Arai Defiant and a Bell Custom 500. This Shoei RJ Platinum-R is as comfortable as the Arai but with the open face feel. It is overall larger than the Bell Custom 500 in it's outer profile but much more comfortable and with much better air flow due to the venting that keeps the liner dry. The visibility is better than the full face but not quite as good as the Bell Custom 500, where I can't see the helmet at all in my peripheral vision. With the Shoei RJ Platinum-R, I can see the cheek area of the helmet but just a little and it's not an issue for me.The fit of this helmet is amazing. Initially I thought I had gotten too large of a size, but checking for movement it was clear that I had good contact everywhere, there was just absolutely no pressure points. It was very light on the head and with the vents open it flows a ton of air over by shaved scalp so it feels like I'm not wearing anything at all.Sunglasses work great without getting pushed around at all. I can still here my bike stereo very well. There's no lifting feel from the visor. The chin strap is super comfortable. There are no pressure points or any pressure on my ears. It's just a well rounded helmet. Clearly this has been around a long time and they have worked out any issues. It's just screams quality to me.I got the flat black which looks good but if I touch it with my gloves it leaves finger marks all over it for some reason. I'll wipe it down with some bike cleaner and see if the protectant kinda seals it.The big selling point to me on this is it's one of the VERY FEW Snell M2010 Approved. So if you want an open face helmet with the most protection you can get and extreme comfort, look no farther.\n",

      "I was on the market for a Snell approved ¾ helmet because my full face helmet was too hot for summer riding. Most, if not all the alternatives I examined triggered nostalgic feelings. This was nice but they also appeared to be almost identical to what I was wearing in the 70’s. As their Snell approval indicates, they may be safer; but something was still missing for me.First of all, I was looking for ventilation, even if an open face helmet was in question. After all, ventilation channels can always be switched off but they are useful on hot weaher and/or at slower speeds. Secondly, I was seeking out a more beautiful helmet than the 70’s offerings, without compromising my nostalgic feelings towards the era.The Shoei RJ Platinum R was just what I was looking for: Snell approved, ventilated and very beautiful IMO. Since I was confident that Shoei would not offer a low quality helmet and since quality comes at a price, I pulled the trigger. I am now so happy that I did.The fit can be either true to size or maybe very slightly large. I am not certain because unlike full face helmets, the cheeks flex a bit. This flex may be misleading me towards wondering if it is slightly large. I purchased an XL for my 62 cm (24.40 inches) head and it fits like a glove. Since my same size Arai Quantum ST full face helmet fits a bit tighter, I may be thinking that the Shoei RJ Platinum R is a bit on the large side. However, once it is on my head, it nicely presses my cheeks and it does not move laterally or vertically, even if I try to move it with my hands.It feels quite light and it is extremely comfortable. The inner materials are velvety with a soft tactile feel which is not skiddy. In other words; perfect. The ventilation is a big bonus for me. I can feel a light breeze on the top of my head if I desire so. I do desire so most of the time in hot weather. I did shut the ventilation off a few times during night riding. Please note that I wore it only above 15?C (59?F) so far, behind the tall windshield of my Harley Road King. I cannot comment on cold weather comfort but I wouldn’t think it would be any different than other ¾ helmets.Again behind the windshield, it is not as noisy as I expected. In fact, it is less noisy than my Arai Quantum ST with the windshield fully open. This is not a fair comparison as the fully open windshield of a full face helmet swishes in the wind but I wanted to give an idea on the noise level. Needless to say, my full face helmet is significantly less noisy when its windshield is closed. The visor of the Shoei RJ Platinum R does not seem to swish, nor does it make my head wobble. On the other hand, it does not help much when facing the sun, either.My regular sunglasses stay securely put in it even if I rotate my head at speed. It is easy to put sunglasses on and off when wearing the helmet, thanks to the purpose built conduits. Nevertheless, I ordered goggles with polycarbonate lenses as regular sunglasses would injure my eye if a solid object hits at speed. As far as I know, there is no bubble shield for this helmet. I don’t know if universal ones or the ones from other manufacturers would fit or not. So, beware if this is your intention.After about a total of 1500 km (930 miles) with this helmet in nice weather, I decided to expand the temperature range I had in mind for using it. I ordered a neoprene half face mask and a neck collar and I already have a balaclava. I am so comfortable with it that I reckon my full face helmet will be on call only in really cold weather.All in all, I can recommend this helmet to anyone who is looking for an open face helmet in this price range.\n",

      "I've been a half helmet Harley rider for about 16 years and this is my first 3/4 helmet. I love it. I have a huge head and always have a hard time finding helmets that fit...part of the reason I've always worn half helmets. The sizing chart was spot on. According to the chart I wear a XXL, but in my mind there was no way that this was correct so I ordered a XXL. I was wrong and for the first time ever I tried on a helmet that was too big. So I ordered an XXL and it is the best fitting helmet I've ever had...snug, but perfectly fit with excellent air flow. I now own two of these helmets, one for me and one for my wife. We went through a few iterations of buying and returning a couple of different helmets and this has the best quality feel. Revzilla was excellent during the delivery/return/refund process. I highly recommend both this helmet and this company. I will continue to order from them for years to come...\n",

Of course, it's not cheap for a 3/4, but I feel secure in it. The Snell rating was key for me. I have a small DOT 1/2 for when I want to go minimal.

      "I got this helmet because I just didn't like the Biltwell Bonanza. The BB looks really cool but I didn't like the chin strap and I just didn't feel safe in it. Medium was too small, so I went with large in the BB although it was a tiny bit too big.At first I got the Shoei in large and had real mushroom head. I swapped out easily with RZ and the medium fits perfectly and looks almost as cool as the BB. I feel a lot safer in the Shoei and almost as cool.Side note: I got the smaller cheekpads so I don't have a smushed face. Perfect fit with that adjustment.So I definitely recommend this helmet.

      "I own a Shoei Qwest full face in 2XL and this RJ-Platinum in 3XL fits my head a bit better. I have a wider, rounder head and the absence of the chin bar gives me a little bit of give that makes the helmet more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. I like to use the RJ-Platinum for around the house driving, and still prefer to wear the Qwest on the highways/freeways going 70+.I wish companies like Arai, Shoei, et al., invested in a few lines that cater to people with rounder heads. Based on what I've read, companies used to have a few lines for rounder heads, but everything is moving towards the middle of the bell curve, i.e. intermediate oval/neutral. I wouldn't mind spending more on a smaller batch produced helmet if it fit my head perfectly. As it is, I have to try on 30+ helmets to find something that works.Love that the RJ-Platinfum is a SNELL certified helmet, one of the very few SNELL certified open faced helmets on the market today. Extremely well made, same shell and interior materials as the higher priced Shoei helmets, but without some of the advanced features, e.g. internal visor, more quiet, etc. At around $300, though, this helmet is great value for the $.\n",

      "I stopped in the Revzilla Philadelphia showroom looking for a new 3/4 open face helmet to match my new 2014 Mysterious Red Street Glide Special. After trying a Bell, a Biltwell and a couple others, I could tell that while they looked great, they weren't for me because I was getting hot spots on my forehead after a could minutes of wear. Their helmet guru, Steve, came over and asked if he could assist me. He took one look at my head and knew the Shoe RJ Platinum R would fit my head shape and that I was a size Medium. He brought it out in what they call their \"wine\" color. Perfect fit, very comfortable and it matches my bike almost exactly. I ordered it a couple weeks later and when I wore it on my first ride, I was astonished at how well it flows air. It was a 90 degree day and my head was dry when I got to work after my 40 minute commute. The helmet is exceptionally comfortable and it is quieter than my previous 3/4 helmet (an Ed Hardy Captain America 3/4 helmet). I noticed I could turn the volume down an average of about 3-5 notches and still hear it just as well, if not better than before. Absolutely love this helmet and highly recommend it. For size comparison, I also have a Bell RS1, Bell Mag9 Sena, an Outlaw USMC Half Helmet, a Schuberth C3 flip face helmet and they are all size Medium, so the Shoei fits true to size.\n",

I normally wear a Large helmet but had to go with Medium for this helmet.- Glasses. They put a little cutout to accomodate glasses but the cutout is too high. The result is that tends to push your glasses up so I have to keep pushing them back down.- Chin strap. They put the snap a little too high so it's a little hard to find the snap until you get used to it.- Comfort. After about an hour I get a little hotspot on my forehead where it seems to be a little tight. I'm hoping that with some break-in time this will go away.- Vent Noise.

      "Ordered this helmet to enjoy with my custom cruiser on the backroads. My interest was in the review of how comfortable it was and the exceptional airflow for those hot summer days. I was not disappointed.This helmet is incredibly comfortable, and I have wore some very uncomfortable ones. The cheek protection provides added wind - and thereby noise - protection. Very comfortable to put on and take off - no cheek burns. Fits like a dream.I have a bit of a long, oval head shape, so I was worried about the fit - I had a hard time finding a helmet brand that focused on this head shape. Although this is a bit noticeable on the sides, the helmet stays put and never bothers me with a loose fit - and without pressing my head at forehead and back until I have a headache. The padding is perfect and keeps the helmet stationery on my head.The noise dampening is pretty good, but I am comparing it to my time in a helmet that did not cover my ears at all. I can hear all I need to hear, and the rest just sounds like background airplane noise. Got used to it quickly, as it really does not bother me.They styling is superb and I get plenty of complements on the looks with my cruiser. The open face is not for everyone, but I don't hit the highways, just the backroads. 50mph (80kph) is my typical limit and the open face works fine...outside of a rain storm.Love this helmet in every way!\n",

If I was to improve this great helmet I would add a quick release chin strap, otherwise you can't go wrong with a Shoei helmet.\n",

      "I have a Shoei full face for long distance touring, but was looking for something more open for around town cruising. Bought a half-helmet last year, but never really felt safe/protected. All the reviews talked about what a great helmet the RJ Air is for those looking for an open face design, with some added safety features and benefits. Worn it only once for a couple of hours but it fits great, is light weight, and makes me feel more protected than a half helmet. Plus it's a Shoei so I know the construction is great and it will last several years. To boot, Revzilla price matched a lower price, and I received my helmet in a matter of day. Great choice and great dealer!\n",

Plus, I smoke while I ride my GoldWing, and one cannot do that with a full-faced helmet, no way, no how.The helmet (size XL) is just a little bit on the large size, as there is a gap in helmet sizes and my head circumference, as instructed to measure -- is in the gap. Ya' might know. Well, better a little too large than a little too small...Although there are vents for air flow, I always wear a Slik before putting on my helmet, which keeps the sweat off the helmet lining; it's warmer in winter and cooler in summer. But it also prevents any of the airflow from the vents from getting to my scalp.All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this helmet.\n",

      "I have been wearing Shoei RJs for the last ten years. It's the most comfortable helmet that fits my head. When I started looking for a new helmet I thought I wanted to go with a modular type, for the added protection but I didn't want the conventional modular because it is realy hot down here riding in traffic and I didn't want the \"sail\" on my head that most flip-ups give you. I first tried the newest Shark Evoline but it's made more for a narrow head and I just wasn't comfortable in it. Then I tried the Nolan Trilogy. The second one finally fit but the helmet was way loud. when I sat on my Victory Cross Country with the engine running. It was like not even wearing a helmet when it came to engine noise. And the most annoying thing was that the lining continually squeaked when I moved my head. Wearing my 5 year old RJ was twice as quiet. So after becoming quite frustrated I decided to just go back to the Shoei.This new Shoei RJ Platinum R fits me better than either of the two predecessors and they were always very comfortable. The helmet is really quiet as far as hearing the engine on the bike. And this one fits so good that there is very little wind noise and I can still hear the stereo well at freeway speeds. Here in the South it is very hot during the summer and I haven't really had the helmet long enough to tell if airflow is better than previous RJs but they were adequate. I really would have liked to have a built-in sunshade as other helmets have but the RJ still just comes with the visor. But the helmet allows the use of sun glasses without any pressure on the temples. Maybe someday I'll find a modular or full face that I can wear but for now the RJ Platinum R is like putting on a new \"old friend\".\n"

It is fairly quiet but I ride a 125cc scooter around town so it has never been worn over 60mph so i cant really judge how noisy it would be at high speed.The only complaint i have is about the space above your ears for your sunglasses. Some shades just don't fit with this helmet. The helmet forces them the shift up off your nose so that the top of the glasses are nearly touching your forehead. Very annoying. But I have other glasses that work just fine with no issues.Overall very nice and high quality helmet that has a snell rating and the brand recognition of Shoei.

Haven't been able to check venting or durability yet, and don't really want to check protection level. The Snell certification is definitely worth the few extra bucks for the added peace of mind over a DOT-only bucket. Wanted a flip-up, but didn't want to pay as much as the only other comparable item I could find. Instead, bought the Paulson five-snap shield. It's a tight fit due to the size of the shell, but the T-shaped slots on the side snaps give me just enough play to get it in place and re-install the peak. Sure wish Shoei would make a good flip-up. It would really come in handy during our South Texas summers! Thanks, Revzilla!\n",

Replacement due to age and desire for more protection in a get off. I wear this helmet on my H-D FXD. I look like a spaceman with an oversized head. It'll do much better than a half helmet but it's goofy looking. I wanted a lower profile helmet but most, like Bell's 500 are Chinese junk and I don't buy stuff made in China if at all avoidable. This Shoei is very well made. I should have ordered a size smaller but I'm not sure it would have completely helped because this helmet fits a round head best, not a long oval. The bottom line: for an open face 3/4 helmet, there is none better. But if you are a smaller person with a small noggin you will look like a spaceman. Trade off for protection....... Don't bother or better yet, if you can stand it, wear a full face helmet!\n",

      "This is my first Shoei in 40 years of riding, and definitely won't be my last. My previous helmet was a modular of another brand and now that I have a bike with a fairing and windshield, I wanted to go back to an open face helmet for the warmer weather. After a lot of research, I decided on the Shoei and I'm very glad I did.Many helmets put pressure on my forehead, but not this one. The fit in my XXL size is spot-on and very comfortable. No pressure at all anywhere. This helmet is very quiet compared to my modular. Hardly any wind noise at all. Part of that may be due to the thick cheek pads. I'm very impressed with how quiet this helmet is at speed. The vents seem to work well. It was 90 degrees this evening when I took off for a ride and while I was a little hot, it was not unbearable at all. I tried the helmet with and without the visor and couldn't tell any difference in buffeting either way (I do have a fairing and shield). Buffeting is very minimal, and due to the shield, not the helmet.Compared to some of the cheaper brands, this helmet is a little pricey. But I've always believed in the saying that you get what you pay for, and this helmet is worth the extra money.\n",

Its almost as if the air avoids your helmet compared to any other helmet. I used to have an X-14 and the pista absolutey trumps it.  The helmet is comfortable, extremey light, provides great vision, and has perfect aero.  While going upwards of 170 this helmet does not lift whatsoever and the field of view while in tuck is great.  I find that the padding in the helmet is exactly where it should be. It is nice and snug on the cheaks which I find most helmets lack.  The helmet is also incredibly light and if you are thinking mere ounces can’t make a difference, you would be very wrong!  The only downsides to this helmet would be the inserts for airflow and the noise, which could easily be solved by putting in some earbuds.  You will not be dissapointed if you buy this helmet.\n",

      "Best Helmet Hands Down\n",
      "I spent a few months reading all the reviews, watching all the video's I could find about the Pista GP R. After finally convincing myself I pulled the trigger and bought this helmet. I am kicking myself in the you know what now asking myself why I waited so long to order it. This is the best helmet I've ever worn...hands down. Yes, it's nose bleed expensive but the old adage comes to mind, \"you get what you pay for.\" Quality is top notch. Fit is perfect. I wear a Medium in the Shoei RF-1200 and bought the MS in the AGV. Perfect snug fit as it should be. The interior liner feels so soft against your skin. The adjustability refines it even more. The vision out of the giant face shield is like watching a movie in IMAX. You can see so much out of the helmet. I feel so much safer riding in city traffic. Yes, I do wear this on the street and track. The review from Anthony said it's not designed for street use but I respectfully say he's so wrong. It can be used for both very well. But yes I do agree it is designed for chin on the tank high speed racing. The ventilation is amazing. I've had the helmet less than a week and been riding with it everyday. Where I live it's been in the low 70's the past few days and I've only have the chin vents open. The vents on the forehead are blocked off but the airflow is like not wearing a helmet...okay maybe not that good but you get the point. Noise is average. I wear custom made ear plugs so most of the ambient noise is gone but even then you don't get any buffeting or droning sound from other helmets. Revzilla's review says that you can't mount a bluetooth system on the Pista. Well I have to respectfully say oh hell yes you can. I just installed the new Sena 30K on the Pista GP R and it fits perfectly. I didn't use the speakers because they are junk. I bought a set of plug phone earplugs/earbuds from Amazon for $19.99 and hooked them up to the earplug jack and routed them through the liner. I tested it out and everything works perfectly with no strain on my ears or head with the system installed. Overall I'm extremely happy with the Pista. I'm planning on buying a 2nd one soon. It's an amazing product and if you can justify the price...go for it. You won't be disappointed.\n",

      "I really don't know how they're selling this for $249. This has to beg the question: Are the other helmets just insanely overpriced? I've been riding since 1999. Started with a Shoei RF-900. Here we are, 2019, after many different lids, and I'm so impressed with this helmet. I think I'm going to stick with AGV from now on. The Corsa R is likely my next lid.\n",

      "I love this Helmet, I have been watching it for years. I love the graphics... I spent time over in Australia and fell in love with this design since it first came out. I waited patiently for the price to come down. For the amount of protection, it's a steal!Only issue was that I measured for the MS and it seemed to tight, gave me a mild headache around my forehead and temples due to the tightness. I then Ordered the ML and it was apparently too loose. I knew they would both break in so I went for the MS and wore it a little here and there around the house. It now doesn't give me a headache anymore but my issue is that I am right between the MS and ML.\n",

      "I’m from a small town but with handfuls of motorcycle shops around the area so naturally I’ve tried it all. For some reason none of them carried AGV? So I pulled the trigger and ordered one online, sizing was an issue and I needed to return my original order to get the correct size but if you can try one on before purchasing I’d HIGHLY recommend it. Once you have the sizing in check I can’t really find any flaws to this lid besides the fact that it does fog up pretty easily under the slightest of weather conditions that is literally my only complaint. It’s extremely stable at +80MPH, I’ve ridden over three hours and absolutely no discomfort. Wind noise is there as with any lid but it’s pretty subdued and what’s actually considered “loud” is honestly subjective. I get compliments left and right as well. I’m extremely happy with the purchase and I definitely feel like I got more than what I paid for within this price range. Side Note: Passengers say that the wind draft off the helmet is so ridiculous that it pushes them back if they aren’t careful lol.\n",

      "Maybe it's because it's my first real helmet I've ever had, or maybe it really is that good (always had the cheapest helmets on the rack, from local shop). I didn't realize how loud and non-aerodynamic my other helmets were, until I got this one. I can hear the chain going around on my bike, because there's absolutely no wind-noise. I've only worn it 2 or so times (the rain just won't stop, here in PA) and received compliments on it (the dreamtime design). I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase, and look forward to getting some colored visors. I was worried the yellow in it wouldn't match my bike, but in real life, it is neon-yellow in the design, so it compliments it nicely (my '18 MT-07 is flat-black with neon-yellow wheels).\n",

      "I originally bought this because of the tinted drop down visor. Took it out for a short ride on local roads and highway 32 degrees F. Visor works great, covers large area and dark. However, on local roads, it can get fogged up if you don't crack open face shield. On the highway, it leaks air very badly on head checks at 60mph. Very loud on the highway.  Minor things to look out for. D-ring does not come with a pull tag. It's hard to unbuckle with gloves on. Lastly, HJC could've made the chinstrap a 1/2inch more towards the front. The strap almost felt like choking, first time putting it on. Great styling, shape, and fit.\n",

      "I bought this half lid as an alternative for highway riding on my cruiser. Prior to this I would use a full face icon alliance gt on my 20 mile commute to work in nyc. Off the bat I noticed the difference, this helmet lets in a lot of air! while still offering protection against bugs, dust and the occasional pebble that a truck might  kick up at high way speeds (that...as we’ve all experienced can be murder on the mug.) the drop down visor is easy to operate with one hand and blocks all air to the eyes. The only weak point in my opinion is that your peripheral vision is limited with the full setup in place. A quick glance down turns into a head nod and looking left or right is a bit more involved causing me to have to turn my head slightly more to check blind spots and neighboring lanes than I would with any of my full face or half helmets for that matter. If you’re a half hazard rider youre going to have to double check more often with this helmet in it’s full setup. Still worth it!\n",

      "The styling of this helmet is very cool and unique. This is the only lid I have owned ( and I have had a lot over the last 38yrs of riding) that everyone who sees it, loves it. It's shape is a true intermediate oval but does run a little small. I stress this because Scorpion helmet normally tend to run slightly large so this is uncommon for them. My nose does get close to the removable face shield but, that was expected due to the design for the visor to seat on the face shield. Air flow is OK but mostly due to the design of the face shield and not the top vents which do not move much air. I only have three real criticisms for this helmet. One, the adhesive used to attach the magnets and the mesh in the face shield is very low quality and needs re gluing almost immediately.  Two, the visor snaps into place utilizing the built in U shaped tabs on the visor and are very weak. Even being careful you will not be able to swap between the clear and tinted shields very many times before they break. Three, the optical clarity of the tinted visor is not very good. It gives everything a hazy look, kind of like you are riding close to a fire and there is a light smoke haze. the clear shield is better but not great. All in all it is a cool helmet and I use it for my shorter commutes and short rides so, it works for me. I wear a full face helmet for longer distance and all day rides.  I would not however advise buying this as your only helmet.\n",

      "No one has one T shirt or pair of jeans,...Right?My \"everyday\" helmet is a Shoei RF-SR and I have to say, that helmet will spoil a person.  But I have always loved the look of this helmet.  So, I figured that just as I have different clothes for summer and winter or different occasions, so should I have different helmets for different rides or moods.The helmet fits just tighter than my Shoei (size XL), not enough to change sizes though and I think the Scorpion is breaking in nicely.  If you are between sizes, I would try the larger choice.  The helmet is comfortable for long trips and the noise level for a HALF helmet (which is what this is) is normal.  I think the sight level is great and the operation of the helmet (visor/strap) is flawless.  The visor works especially well, with great optics and a secure seal to the face cover.  The face cover is a rubber/plastic composite that snaps in place with finger operated locks on each side.  It operates securely and deflects the bugs but will offer next to not for protection in a fall.  Please make no mistake about the fact that this is a HALF helmet and don't kid yourself!The only disappointment was in the top vents and their poor operation.  They seem to offer nothing in the way of airflow.  This is a real problem because I anticipated using this in the summer.  The top vents are the only reason for the lower scores above.For me, the lack of airflow is not a deal breaker.  I purchased this helmet for the style and that it meet Cali's safety requirements.  If I could only have one helmet, this one wouldn't be it.  But I'm am so glad I am able to have a choice.\n",

Was a little nervous about it due to all the reviews I read about the noise level (pretty much the only negative) however, I am extremely happy with the purchase and the noise level is way better than I expected but let me explain.  The helmet I used before was a true half face helmet that I wore on my FXDB Street Bob (Harley) and was pretty used to very loud wind and noise.  Using the Scorpion Covert has dulled that noise down by half!  Now, if you started riding or have got spoiled by really quite helmets, this may not be the one for you, but don't let all the negative reviews saying this helmet is super loud keep you away because, it's really not. The other negative I read was about how the muzzle felt like it would blow off... again I so far have found this untrue and to be honest, has not even been a concern of mine while riding.

      "I always start my reviews with a summary. This is my first AGV helmet and honestly cannot find many faults with this version. AGV hit a home run with this road worthy helmet, a vast improvement over the more off-road biased AX-8.Style: First off, this helmet is beautiful. The fit and finish, style and feel make me think it should be worth more. This helmet is a multifaceted piece of tech. It can be used in four configurations and each work impeccably.  Safety: DOT and ECE rated.  I tested the original clear visor that came with it and scratched it with minor gravel throws. I prefer tinted visors in Florida and chose to destroy the clear one. It is scratched to hell, intentionally, and I shot some pellets at it as well.  The visor did very well, I give it a 5 stars on visor safety. I have the Carbon version, and although light, if it was dropped it would scratch and chip immediately. Not saying this would impair the safety, just the aesthetics.  I trust it and wear it daily.Weight:I held the Klim Krios Pro with this helmet and this helmet felt lighter. It is incredibly light, even after I put a comm system on it.  Noise:For a Carbon helmet, does incredibly well. See airflow and comm system.Airflow:This is where it is great and not so great. I only rate airflow in helmets when the visor is closed.  The airflow is not that great with all vents open in the normal configuration.  I would say 3 stars out of 5.  Where it bumps up to 5 stars if if you remove the mouth vent cover, which gives it a massive amount of air, but no filter.  So, you will be well ventilated, but if you are riding a bike with no windscreen, you are going to catch bugs and dust in your face.  I have a windscreen on my bike, so no worries for me.  It does make it louder in this configuration though.Comm System:I have a Cardo Packtalk Slim JBL Speaker unit on my helmet.  Yes the AGV is not on the list from Cardo's website, but mine fits with very minor modification to the Shalimar lining.  Works great, and can easily move to another helmet with no visual damage to the helmet if you wanted to resell. Sounds wonderful, helmet is quiet enough to listen to music at highway speeds no problem. Yes it has speaker pockets.Comfort:The most comfortable helmet I have ever worn.  This includes my old Arai XD-4, which chopped my ears off every time I put it on. The Shalimar lining is wonderful, and although AGV placed buttons on the forehead area to connect the liner to the helmet, you cannot feel it at all when wearing. Also, the lining easy to wash and replace if needed.Peak:The peak is enormous and very stiff. It blocks the sun brilliantly. It does catch a bit of air at highway speeds when doing head checks, but AGV is selling a short peak to assist in sport/adv touring applications. I'm certain this will change the slight buffeting from the head checks. Also, with the clear pinlock ready visor, you can buy a transitions lens for this visor. The large peak does cause some issues with the transitions plnlock...Have not tried the short peak version, but may also do the same.Chin strap:Double D ring is long and the shalimar lining covers your entire chin.  Great set-up, but I fell in love with the fidlock, so AGV, fidlock please!!!Criticisms:1. Need to improve airflow (bigger forehead venting), bigger channels.  2. Tool-less visor and peak removal, please!Summary:This is one of the best helmets of 2019 in my opinion.  It is light, quiet, comfortable, looks great and at the price point, on par or less than other comparables.  ECE rating is a plus for me, as I do not like straight DOT helmets. The non-Carbon version is very affordable and is the same in every respect accept obviously the weight. Can't wait to see what else comes out in 2020.\n",

      "I typically never write reviews but thought differently this time since I finally graduated from a Half to a full faced helmet.Did a fair bit of research to narrow in on my \"First\".Was a bit skeptical from price point but then pulled the trigger on the Carbon knowing a helmet is not something I shall buy frequently...….hopefully ;-)Super light weight, amazing air circulation is what I noticed when cruising at 70+mph.Great range of view as already indicated in the video review.There is wind noise but hard for me to comment considering I am going from a Half helmet to a full, so the comparison would not be fair.Really happy with this one.Possibly shall be looking into another AGV (with some bright graphics) to add to the mix.\n",

      "For the last several years I’ve worn an Icon Airmada. Not a bad helmet for its price but not great either. The AX-9 makes several firsts for me: its my first top-tier brand helmet, my first dual sport helmet, and the first full carbon helmet I’ve ever laid hands on. My carbon size Large weighs in at 3lbs 1oz. Its like not wearing a helmet at all! The interior is perfect, quiet and cushy. It sits high, the bottom edge of the helmet follows my jawline, making head mobility very high.   My only small nit-picks are: 1) the chin vent moves a TON of air, but the vents up top seem to do very little even in 70° weather. I simply wish it had more vents. 2) The flap of fabric under the chin sits right across the edge of my jaw, which is not the most beard-friendly feeling.  As you’d expect at any speed the peak catches gusts of wind when looking around, but its very effectively placed and I was thankful for it on the very first ride. Overall, the fit and finish is astounding. The comfort level is so high that it honestly begins to feel as though aren’t wearing a helmet at all. A definite A+ from me, AGV killed it with this helmet!\n",

      "Just bought this helmet two months ago and already I have warmed up to it quite nicely.  I bought an XL, Matte Black/Orange Warmup to match my Orange/Rootbeer colored Kawasaki Z900RS.  My head is more elongated than most and the helmet is a little tough to get on, but once on, it is snug and I feel well protected with no movement of the helmet from side to side at all.I do not find it noisy as some state, but I am coming from a Modular HJC, which is now my back-up helmet.  I find the air flow less than I expected from other reviewers, but then again, a Modular has air everywhere.  I would like to have the drop-down dark visor, but my sunglasses fit just fine in the helmet.One detail I may have missed in Anthony's review, I find no way adjust those two chin vents at the bottom in the front.  Is my helmet different?For the price, I think it is great and will probably buy up a different AGV to see if I can find one that really does have lots of air coming in.  I live in south Texas, and with 100 plus days in June, July and August, I need more air please!\n",

      "This is my first helmet that isn’t a super low budget helmet. It is a great buy. Fit is accurate. I have ridden about 700 mile in it so far, including two days of 5+ hours of riding. I did have one pressure point right in the middle of my forehead, right above the browline. I could feel where the hard foam was sticking out a little more than the rest of it. A little pressing with my thumb smoothed it out and it’s fit perfectly since then. Airflow is pretty good. Enough to stay cool and comfortable in Texas heat at any speed above 30.  My cheaper AFX helmets flowed more air, but those shields also didn’t seal at all, so... speaking of the shield, it’s perfectly clear, cleans easily, and has a practically airtight seal. Like other reviews noted it does tend to fog easily in the mornings, but the little chin area lever that cracks the shield open always clears it up. In case my wife stumbles upon this review, all I have left to say is that it is completely stable at high speeds on a sport bike - no buffering or chin lift at all. Quiet enough to listen to music, but earplugs are definitely recommended. Nothing feels cheap about this helmet, can’t quite believe it is as affordable as it is.\n",

My only complaint (and why I had to give it 4 stars) is the chin/mouth vent will just come open from gravity.  Not sure if this is just my helmet or universal, but the vents themselves don't tend to stay closed.  That aside, I have this running with a Sena 10S and I can hear just fine even in opened mode.  The sun visor is adequate although if the sun is blaring directly in your vision, you will probably still have to squint or raise a hand to better shield, but it does still help on bright days.  Overall, a great beginner or budget helmet that has a few slight hinderences.\n",

I ride a GSX-R 1000 and wanted to switch things up a bit.  The Scorpion was a great fit for the speed and the cruising that I do here in Italy.  The HJC's noise level makes it hard to hear my Cardo headset at speeds above 130 mph, but at or near 100 mph it does great.  Once you enter a more aggressive head tilt (cant think of a better word) the wind noise picks up greatly.  The fit and finish is amazing.  I really like the graphics and colors.  The venting is great and really cools you off.  Internal speaker cutouts really fit my Cardo PackTalk audio kit very well.  Over all a great purchase and an amazing helmet.

      "Sadly I tested this helmet last weekend against a guard rail. I high sided, and slid head first into a guard rail at about 40mph (guessing). The helmet did it's job well. I walked away with some minor road rash, but no concussion, and no head injuries. It never shifted during the accident, the shield never came up (slid on it for a ways), and it did not deform at all. It has abrasion from sliding, but the impact did not deform it. Very happy with it's reliability. Just bought another one to replace it. The rain vent functionality on the shield is perfect for cold weather riding. Helps keep from fogging, without opening up enough to allow in rain/snow. The cheek pads are a little bit more snug than my Bell Vortex was, but I got used to it and felt safer in it. Less movement. My one complaint is the speaker holes were just barely too small for my Sena speakers that came with the 20S. I had to cut a small piece of the plastic out to allow it to fit properly. Wasn't a big deal to me, but I assume this would void any warranties on the helmet. The smaller ones they sell separately will likely fit out of the box. Overall, great product for the price. I spent a lot of time looking for an affordable helmet that still met Snell 2015 standards, and I am happy with my choice. Would recommend.\n",

I have a mirrored visor on it and thus far remains crystal clear without a scratch. The only downside I've found is the amount of air (=wind noise) that comes in from the bottom (though that could be due to my collared jacket or my scrawny neck lol). And it really wants to lift and float at highway speeds (70). I have a cruiser with no windshield or lower deflectors.

The padding near ears are nice and comfortable if you wear glasses which is very nice.The downside, if you ride a touring Harley like I do, you're not going to get a lot of air into this thing, even with the giant air ducts. It's not horrible you still get a noticeable amount, but fogging can be a real issue in rain. I ended up spending the extra money to get a flat track shield and pinlock because it was absolutely unusable in the rain unless the visor was cracked, and even then it wasn't perfect.

      "If you live in an area with humid and hot temperatures, this lid should be on your list of options. Airflow is incredible with many vents available - the vents are easy to locate and operate with a gloved hand. With this air flow you're going to have your fair share of wind noise, but it's nothing ear plugs can't remedy.The finish is great. I love putting the helmet on and I think the Transect graphic is very sharp without being overbearing. I picked the red option and it matches my other gear/bike quite well. Inside you have emergency cheekpad removal system which will come in handy if you ever go down and need medical assistance (knock on wood). The liner is quite comfortable and easily removable for washing.As far as features go you have a chin curtain, multiple vents on the top and on the chin, and a lever that cracks the shield open slightly for defogging and additional airflow. It would have been nice to have a drop down visor, but at this price point and the other features you can't really complain. The visor does fog in cold temperatures so I'll be looking into investing in a pinlock shield at some point. I can't wear my glasses in this lid in heat as they fog instantly from the temperature/sweat, but this may vary for other riders. Contact lenses fix that problem for me.In short - wear some ear plugs, invest in a pinlock visor, and you've got yourself a great budget lid that will last for plenty of years. Snell rating along with DOT is just icing on the cake.\n",

      "I've been wearing this helmet for the past 3-4 months and I'm VERY happy wth this purchase.  The airflow is great and controlled easily.  The visor fits snugly and has a nice feature to crack it open just slightly.  The only drawback is that it doesn't have a quick release latch...It has the traditional double loop strap.  Not very load, nice comfortable fit and nice looking design.\n",

      "I've owned this helmet for roughly a year now. I bought it to replace an HJC CL-17 that was getting on in age. It's a huge upgrade for not that much of a jump in price. It's significantly lighter, it flows air much better, and much less adept to making you look like a bobblehead. With this helmet I've:* Used for regular (daily) commuting* Done track days* Rode ~1,400 miles to Sturgis and back* Rode 1,150 miles for an IBA Saddlesore 1000* Done motovlogging* Had many kids think I was a Power RangerBut to get to the skinny of it,Pros:* Excellent vision* Great amount of airflow for the summer months* Includes a chin spoiler which is handy for a communicator (I've got a Sena 20S mounted in mine) and winter temps* The \"crack-open\" lever feature is great for defogging and extra airflow* Snell 2015 rated, on top of standard DOT* Relatively light (much lighter than polycarb helmets)* Little to no buffeting when side-checking* Liner and cheek pads are removable, with emergency pull tabs* PriceCons* Lenses for this helmet, like many others in their range, come with \"anti-fogging\" coating that wears over time. This one's no exception. Nothing beats a pinlock system* For me, and I think this is just due to face shape, the curtain lets in a lot of air; great for summer, bad for the ears. Gotta wear plugs anyway though* Made in China (still, it's Snell M2015 rated, but just doesn't have the same/similar exotic materials of its Shoei/Arai counterparts. Personal gripe; take it for what you will)If you're a beginner to intermediately-experienced rider, looking for a helmet that's pretty well-rounded in most bike style categories, this is a great choice. I'm upgrading to a Shoei Quest, which doesn't have a removable liner or emergency cheek pad pull tabs. This Exo-R710 does (what the crap, Shoei).\n",

      "I have owned 2 helmets that were both sub $200 USD. My most recent, which I used until today, was a GMAX that I paid $140 for 6 years ago.I did months of research trying to find the best bang for buck (I am on a budget). I compared several helmets feature for feature, and opted to go with usability and safety over strictly looks. I finally decided to make the jump to a middle grade helmet, and I was definitely NOT disappointed. The pictures don't do this helmet justice. It arrived quickly, as does everything from Revzilla! The helmet is B. E. A. Utiful. It was nicely packaged and I love that it came with a quality helmet bag and bag for the extra visor. The helmet was snug to get on and off, and each time I put it on I have to fix my ears, but once it's on it is secure. It feels good on my head (even being bald). The padding on the chin strap makes it feel like the chin strap isn't even there. The lens are phenomenal. Felt like I was riding in High Def. This helmet moves plenty of air as well. The visor has strong detents which I'm a huge fan of. The multi-setting air intake ports are a nice feature too. The air cheek pad system absolutely helps to customize the fit around your cheeks. I gave mine 3-4 pumps and it feels great when riding. Today was a windy day and I can't say that I experienced any buffeting even doing head checks at speed. This helmet is worth every penny. The SNELL 2015 rating is the icing on the cake. Can't wait to put this helmet through its paces. If you're considering this helmet, just do it. You won't be disappointed.\n",

      "This is my first helmet but I wanted a safe helmet that wouldn’t break the bank. I researched helmets for almost a month and found a great video by fortnine about helmet safety and materials used, safety rating systems, and features to look out for or avoid. I also know that by being brand loyal you sometime pay for a name not features/safety. 1) Safety FirstI came across the scorpion R2000 and it has a Snell Rating (one of the safest for protecting your brain box), due to the aramid, organic fibers that spread and slow the impact forces. The helmet also has dual density foam which is better for faster AND slower impacts so you are covered for both just Incase. The emergency pad removal system can also save your neck in a wreck making it easier for medical professionals to remove your helmet and stabilizing your neck.  2) Features SecondYou can’t beat the visor systems (on/off and open/close), vents/air flow, cheek adjustment, or weight to safety to fit ratio for the priceOver all I’m super glad I did my research and landed such a great helmet with safety being the main goal and an awesome looking hi-viz color that doesn’t make me look like a plain highlighter marker. It is the best of looks and features for the price (go down in price and risk your materials becoming less safe, go up in price and you’ll spend way more just for a name). Well done scorpion!\n",

I have to say that this helmet was an amazing first helmet for me. The only issue I had with the helmet was that during the first couple days of riding, there was a pressure point at the back right part of my head towards the top which made it sore. But after a little breaking in. I've never had the problem since. Airflow is excellent, Feels like wearing a pillow after breaking in. Highly Recommend!\n",

      "This is my first helmet and I was a little worried about the risk of buying it without trying it on.  However, I could not be happier with the purchase. After spending the better part of an hour trying on various helmets in a local shop I was set to buy a Shoei that fit great and fit my criteria until I decided to take a little longer to think on this helmet. The store didn't have any Scorpions so I was going blind with what I'd get if I ordered the Scorpion. Once I got it and tried it on I knew I made a good choice. Almost $300 less than the shoei and in my opinion fit much better and has inflatable cheek pads. Came with both visors and bags for the helmet and visor of very nice quality. I've rode over 1000 miles on my new bike at night, heavy rain, high speeds and the vents are amazing. Not to mention the only time the anti fog visors had a slight hint of fogging was pitch black night downpour rain storm in south east humidity. Cons: There are a few small down sides. I have a medium and the fit was snug and perfect the day I got it and tried it on but since wearing it more it's worn in and has more play, but I have a pretty small head. There are no pre designed cut outs or such for a headset but it's more of a racing helmet so I'm not surprised. I do have a Sena 30k installed in it with very little modification and with the increased space from wear the ear phone's sit right next to my ears without touching them. Lastly, it's a pretty noisy helmet but I ride with all the vents open and I prefer the air flow and anti fog over perfect silence. Very happy with my purchase and if nothing else comes out that catches my interest I will more than likely purchase a second for a dedicated track helmet.\n",

      "I'm a cheap-a**, but I also want good gear.  This helmet has been near-perfect for me -- so much so that I can definitely say I will continue to buy scorpion products into the foreseeable future.PROS (x8):-Eyeglasses fit perfectly.-No uncomfortable spots anywhere in the helmet.-Airfit system is AWESOME.-The included dark smoke shield is a life saver, and super easy to change out.-It is bright and definitely gets the kind of attention you want for a hi-viz piece of gear.-The air flow is great, and the anti-fog property is pretty good.-Wind noise isn't terrible but, AS WITH ALL HELMETS, you should ALWAYS wear ear plugs (if legal in your state).  If you tilt your head more forward, a lot of the higher-pitched wind will be cut out and you'll be left with just the more bass-y wind noise.-The helmet is balanced very well -- I don't notice my head wanting to tip over any which way EVER, which is nice.CONS (only x1):-Since this is a track-oriented helmet and meant to be as aerodynamic as possible, there are NO POCKETS FOR BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS.  There is only enough space in the \"pocket\" for your ear to fit.  If you can fit both the speakers AND your ears in there, you have probably bought the wrong-sized helmet, or the wrong-shaped helmet.  I have already contacted Scorpion directly about this, and they have verified this as well regarding Bluetooth comm. systems.ALL-IN-ALL this is a fantastic helmet and, if you don't really need bluetooth, I would recommend this 1000 times over.\n",

I've already gotten compliments from pedestrians on the looks. The visor has major flaws. (1) it only has an opening tab on the left... sometimes you want to use your right, why not put one there too, like my other scorpion?? (2)The lever to crack the visor opens it only a very small amount, and just makes it crooked, it stays closed on the right side. (3) the smoke visor, and granted this is my first time using one, is optically very weird and not good. the fabric is less supple than my other scorpion. I'm not returning it, but I really wanted to love this helmet, and I just don't. The visor lever not opening it evenly, or enough, is perhaps the biggest flaw\n",

      "This is my first new helmet, after 2 years running a TMS star helmet I was done with the weight, the whistling, and the poor aerodynamics. After a month of watching video reviews from revzilla I finally went with the scorpion exo-r2000 ravin hi-viz. Ordering was quick and easy (financed with affirm). There was an extra day of handling to allow the loan to process, but once it was processed I got it the next day. It was sitting on my front porch when I got home. Let me be clear when I say I almost punched myself in the face picking this thing up because it was so light, even in the box. I was amazed at how little the package weighed. That's the shipping experienceI opened up the box and everything was nicely packed. The helmet was in its own bag with the clear lens already attached, and the smoked lens was in a separate one. Both lenses were crystal clear with 0 scratches, even with the sticker removal, the clear lens was brand new out of the box. There wasn't a nic, ding, or scratch on anything. Very pleased.I immediately went for the visor swap since there wasn't a cloud in the sky. It was Very simple, very quick, and very easy. I had a little trouble popping the second side of the smoked lens into place, but it was more me being cautious not to break anything since ive never pulled a visor before (TSM had a drop down sun shade). The D-ring fastener for the chin strap works great. Ive had some that would \"lock up\" if you just slid the strap through and have it a tug, this one requires minimal effort to tighten, and when its tight, it stays there. The snap on the end of the strap was easy to fasten as well. The two vents at the top and the one at the bottom of the visor are very easy to adjust (3 settings; closed, half open, fully open). The one above the visor near the brow is very tight and a little hard to work when riding but I believe with a little more use the muscle memory will kick in. It took me a while to figure out the visor lock on the left side of the helmet, but once I did it was a very nifty tool. The lever is very stiff out of the package to the point where I thought I was going to break it. But it loosened up quickly. The lever has 4 settings, lock (furthest up setting, visor must be closed tight to lock), two operational settings (one allows for a secure \"snap\" shut, the other is a soft shut) and the 4th actually keeps your visor cracked a hair (and I mean a hair). As for the pump system it works as it should. Now for the test ride. I was amazed at how light it was, (4.6lbs vs 3.5lbs) very comfy. The liner is soft and wicks sweat great if you get there. The air flow is amazing. Test ride day was the warmest day of the year and even in full leathers I nearly broke a sweat, even in town. The visor is easy to get to, easy to open and close on the easy open setting. The aerodynamics of this lid are night and day better than my old helmet. Open road and behind traffic I had no head shake, behind a big rig I got a little left and right pressure, but hardly enough to notice. Cross winds had no effect at all. As for noise this helmet is very quiet even at higher speeds. I get a little collar noise around 50-60 but i believe it has something to do with my jacket collar (if I extend my neck noise almost disappears). The lock had a hint of drag noise, but you have to look for it to hear it. I got no lift in the rear of the helmet even when looking up or riding upright at high speeds. In the full tuck this helmet is whisper quiet in my opinion. Upwards of 140-150 with hardly any wind noise to my surprise. I am impressed.As far as fitment goes I am a large-medium or a small-large. I bought a large and it is maybe a hair to big for me, but I can just grow my hair out and be fine (see what I did there?).  Getting into this thing is tight, but that's almost a requirement these days. For anyone who skipped to the end this helmet is a great buy. I was skeptical on spending $399 on a lid, but am glad I did. The noise is good, quality visors, ruggid changing mechanism, cool, comfy, and sporty looking. I only went with 4 stars because there is no way to close the exhaust ports and living in upstate ny makes it a little chilly on morning commutes. Otherwise Scorpion has me sold, will be buying again for the girlfriend soon.\n",

      "Very nice helmet. I had started with scorpion helmets when I first started riding about 6 years ago. Back then they were round helmets and gave me a horrible pressure point on my forehead so I went to Aria and Shoei helmets and never looked back. But I have been starting to hate the opening mechanism on my Aria. Love the helmet but it actually hurst my wrist trying to open the visor and its impossible to open with winter gloves on (they are starting to change that though so Im waiting until the model I wear has the new opening and closing mechanism). In the meantime this is a great helmet, the full curtain does cut down on the wind noise. But because this is a full race helmet it is tight. Very hard to get on but once on its fits great. Only problem is that it smashes my left ear and after about an hour of riding my left ear hurts. Thats the only complaint I have against this helmet, make a little bit more room for the ears and I won't go back to an Aria.\n",

      "I have a pretty big head.  And this helmet runs small, unfortunately.  I originally had purchased a Scorpion EXO R410 - in a size 2XL.  Fits perfectly.  Very comfortable.  I wanted to upgrade to a high viz helmet and was intrigued by the inflated cheek pads as well as getting the smoke visor included.Unfortunately, even though this helmet is the exact same brand and helmet shape as the R410, the fit is much different.  If I were to push my chin forward in this helmet, it would rub against the front of the helmet.  Not the case with the R410. I was able to get by riding with the Ravin, even though it was a little more uncomfortable, but when I put my Sena in the helmet with the speakers, my ears have absolutely no room.  Can't even get my ears to fold up correctly.So I've reverted back to my R410.  Although this helmet feature wise is much better than the R410 with more vents, inflatable cheek pads, even velcro ready internal speaker holders... I can't wear it because it's too uncomfortable for my big a$$ head.For riders with normal heads, this helmet is awesome.  However, be cautioned that this helmet size is different even from their other brand helmets.  Seems to be more round while my other scorpion helmet is more of a long oval, although both are listed to be intermediate oval.\n",

I got nearly everything i wanted with this helmet, an included smoke visor, an airfit system (which is the whole reason i bought this helmet) for that perfect fit and pretty cool graphics. I go the medium and it was a solid fit, though my face is a little more ovular, with the airfit system it is a perfect fit. I love the high visibly, especially in low light. The interior can be a bit noisy at times but i can't expect it to be quiet for a race helmet. I think this is a very good investment for a helmet, especially at the $300 price range.\n",

      "... most of the meat of my review is in the bar graphs, but I will say this: If you buy this helmet, but the pin lock insert at the same time. The breath deflector works somewhat, but the geometry of the face shield, and it's locking position makes this helmet fog up VERY quickly in any temperature approaching 50 degrees. If you are a summer rider, and don't venture out in early morning or after dark, then it won't matter much. All weather/All Season riders beware.On that same note, if you don't winterize your bike, you're also going to want to invest in a real chin curtain as well. Great airflow in this helmet, but that's what you don't want at 40 degrees' and below.\n",

      "After a year and thousands of miles of riding I still think this is the best helmet I've owned.My head shape is classified as a round oval, but is really more of a square shape - think Dolf Lundgren.  After trying on many brands I settled on the Shoei as the most comfortable.  Cheek pads were very tight at first but have since adjusted to my face.  Still a snug fit, but not tight.  The helmet is very comfortable to wear for long rides and multiple days. Aerodynamic and much quieter than my HJC.  The moulded speaker wells provide ample room for my Sena speakers and are properly placed for optimum sound transfer without creating a hotspot on my ear.  I can now carry on a conversation up to 70 mph rather than the 50 mph with my HJC.The web photos don't do the Reborn graphic justice.  It is way cool!Airflow is excellent.The extended jawline of the shell provides additional protection over a traditional 3/4 helmet without affecting visibility.  Peripheral vision is excellent.Internal visor works very wellGripes:  Only two. 1) A quick release chin strap would have been nice. Not a big deal. 2) For the price, this helmet should come with the optional pinlock visor.  Because of the airfoil at the bottom edge of the face shield, airflow behind the shield is limited.  Below 50F the shield fogs badly and clears slowly.  The pinlock is a must at lower temperatures.  This is a safety issue.  You can remedy this problem for about $35, plus shipping, but be careful to purchase the correct model pinlock (Shoei CJ-2 EVO).Overall, I am extremely happy with this helmet and would buy it again, without question.\n",

      "After years of riding with full face and modular helmets, I decided I wanted to try an open face for enhanced visibility and feeling more connected to what was going on around me.  I have a modular Shoei, with an internal sun shield, so I decided to try a similar set up in an open face design.  I am so glad I bought this helmet.  It feel so much more open than the modular or full face helmets I've been wearing. I took it on a long ride in the mountains, and the experience looking at the scenery was so much better than with my modular.  I expected that with an open face, but what I didn't expect was that noise and wind were not much worse than with the full face.  The shield comes down so low that you don't even really notice the shield is there.  The internal sun shield works great.The only con is out of the box the fit is a little tight at the jawline, but I think it will be fine once it gets a little more broken in.\n",

Fit is similar to Shoei. Can wear sunglasses with comfort. Ventilation: Forehead & Chin. Small. Unnoticeable effects at speed or static, best ventilation is shield up. Exhaust vents in the back. Price : For the money an excellent deal. Noise: Acceptable No chin curtain. Does not deny surrounding traffic background sounds. Shield: I replaced the clear with a smoke version. Ratchets up and down without issue. Haven't used the lock button. It doesn't have a drop down sun-shield, but that is an acceptable trade off for the price.

      "First impressions: Rode with touring windshield and ear plugs.  Got the white one.  I need it for highway riding.  Fits well, comfortably snug, quiet, visible, and looks good. I put on all the included accessories, including the pinlock, chin curtain and nose guard.   With visor closed, it removes wind noise from the middle frequencies, and leaves a little from the lower when there's a wind gust.  This is important since ear plugs by design do not attenuate middle frequencies a whole lot, and wind noise can get really loud on the highway with the wrong helmet.  You can lower the noise levels more if tuck down to top-of-windhsield height and tilt your head down slightly.  This would be more the sport riding position, which I'm guessing is how it was tested.  I've ridden with the HJC RPHA and the Schuberth C3, and overall this was quieter and more comfortable for me.Of course, being new, vision is crystal clear.  I wore my riding sunglasses. We'll see how it holds up after it gets broken in.I was overdue for an upgrade and I'm happy I got it!  Never go too long with an old helmet.\n",

My 700 was fairly tight in the forehead but really only bothered me on several hour rides. I recently ordered a small R710 for my son and tried it on. I wore it for about 10 minutes and it was extremely tight all around but more so front to back. After reading reviews for my EXO 700 which claims the helmet is more of a round helmet, I figured the R710 in medium would be a good fit since it is supposed to be an intermediate oval which is what I believed my head to be. Perhaps I'm more of a long oval. It turns out it was too loose on the sides. The cheek pads barely touched my cheeks and I could easily fit my fingers between the sides of my head and the rigid foam. My head measures 56.5 cm so I'm right in between a small and a medium and neither one really works for me. I tried on an HJC FG-17 that a friend ordered and it was a much better fit.\n",

Even when brand new, I didn't feel any pressure points after a couple hours of riding.It breathes very well with all of the vents open. Of course this does make it slightly loud. With ear plugs it's not that bad. Also the lever that opens the shield slightly for air works well.It feels well-balanced on my head, not too heavy.

I did however have a wreck at the track as well with this helmet on and it did it’s job. I won’t say it was like pillows when I hit the ground but no head or neck trauma. Wind noise is pretty minimal with all vents closed. Once a again, great for upright street riding, not for track where you have to be in any kind of a tuck position.

I wish the sharps testing results were better (no Im not from the UK or europe but like to thoroughly research a product before I buy it). Fiberglass/composite shell is amazing at this price point but seems like it might be really thin.\n",

      "This is my first helmet, purchased for passenger needs (that will change, as we all know...)  The inaugural ride was in 100 degree heat, on the twisty roads of Hwy 1.  Airflow was great.  I purchased it over the EXO -R420 partially because it had more air vents, and boy, did they help!  The ability to crack open the shield for additional air was great.  Comfortable, firm, but not squished fit.  It made my neck ache a touch, but that was likely because I'm not used to wearing a helmet and my head was turned a bit to the right the whole time.  the only negative/quirk was that the breath deflector popped off easily while carrying the helmet open.  it's intended to come off, but in that instance, easy to lose.\n",

      "I've always like the Scorpion products, from their helmets and riding gear. High quality that won't break your bank. And the Fuji EXO-R710 is a great example of that. The picture on the site doesn't do this helmet justice. Upon seeing the helmet out of the box, wow the color is just amazing. All the vents are easy to operate with gloves on and the quality is superb. And I think once I get the smoke shield it will even look better. The padding looks and feel great. It's DOT, ECE and Snell certified. This helmet delivers.\n",

      "My new Scorpion EXO-R710 helmet really makes my ride a lot more enjoyable. It was a little snug at first but it’s quickly becoming more comfortable. Airflow is excellent, with so many well placed vents. The shield doesn’t really stay where I put it in the open positions, but that’s probably because of the windshield on my R1150RS. I’ve had compliments on the way the helmet looks. Overall I’m very satisfied with the helmet. I’d buy it again and I definitely recommend it. Also, the size chart is very accurate and it helped me order the correct size. I had been ordering Large in other helmets (KBC and HJC) but I got a Medium in the Scorpion and it’s about perfect.\n",

      "Great for the money\n",
      "My previous helmet was an LS2, and I enjoyed wearing that helmet while I had it. I liked the features it provided but I was looking for a helmet that was snell rated and relatively inexpensive. It sounds counterintuitive but I have a difficult time justifying paying hundreds of dollars for a helmet that will need to be replaced in five years whether I use it or not. I value my life and that is what led me to look for cheaper snell rated helmets. This helmet in the blue graphic caught my eye and for the price I was elated. I purchased it based off of the sizing chart provided by revzilla and it was right on the money. So far I really enjoy wearing the helmet. The neck tabs on the chin strap are long enough to comfort my throat and don't cause irritation. The face shield feels cheap, and I dislike having to use two visors when riding. To get around this, the helmet does allow for sunglasses to be worn underneath and these do not cause any discomfort that I have found. The airflow is much better than the Bell qualifier DLX which I bought at the same time to compare the two. In the end the features provided on the R710 beat out the DLX except for the transition face shield. Snell rated, good airflow, emergency pull tabs, not terribly loud, reasonably priced, and colors that matched my bike. I'm happy to have gone with the R710 and I think in the future I will get one for my wife if she decides to ride with me.I wish it had a transition face shield or a pin lock design, but Scorpion did a good job with this one I think.\n",

      "This is my first Scorpion helmet, my other was a HJC modular, and I was looking for a Snell rated with great reviews at a great price point. I've worn the helmet now 6 times and it has been great. I was medium in my HJC and would say this is the same fit as that. First off, the helmet is very quiet compared to my old helmet. The HJC was loud. I typically ride with all the vents open and even crack the visor and with all that it is much quieter than my old helmet. Outside of the awesome color scheme to match my Triumph Daytona 675, the thing I love the most is the way the air flows over the helmet. I can push 80+ in upright position and my head doesn't move from the wind. I was shaking constantly with my HJC. I do have a Puig racing screen on the bike but this was in upright position, so it is great. Definitely recommend.\n",

      "When I first got into riding I bought a cheap little Bilt helmet. It was a terrible helmet that fogged up instantly and I absolutely couldn't stand the thing. On top of that it was only DOT rated and with how crappy all the features on it were I knew it wouldn't hold up well in a crash. I did a lot of research for a budget helmet and the R710 came up at the top of my list. This helmet met all of my standards very well. The neon hi viz looks amazing accented with the black and the dark smoke visor. Very happy with the ventilation, it all is functional not just for looks. All of it is very tactile and easy to use with gloves on. The shield locking mechanism  works very well and seals it down very so at high speeds there's no whistle and it doesn't fly up. It also cracks open so at low speeds and high traffic you don't suffocate, but you can also keep the shield down if you're riding into the sun. It's very comfortable and the double D ring is very easy to use. The liner has emergency labeling on it so trained medical responders know to take your helmet off without damaging your spine or anything else that could be injured further when taking off the helmet improperly. All this and a SNELL 2015 rating lets me put full faith in this helmet. All for around 250 including the visor was an amazing purchase!\n",

It was then that I found out what a wonderful job Revzilla does reviewing their helmets they offer. They are very thorough and from what I could tell, not biased at all. Thank you Revzilla. I did not know anything about the LS2 helmets but I liked what I heard. My goal was to find a full faced quality helmet that was light and comfortable but not a $400.00 + helmet. From the video review, I felt the Citation may fit the bill. Well it more than did that. I tried it for the first time yesterday on a 6 hour ride and I can say it is the most comfortable helmet I have ever owned. At times I forgot I had it on. Light, quiet, great chin strap system.

      "I bought this after I had to return the HJC RPHA because it was too round - but I really liked that one.  This helmet fit my intermediate oval head mostly well.  The only issue I have was the chin strap pulled right at my adams apple on my neck.  This causes me to loosen the strap a little which causes the helmet to raise up on my head at speeds.  I noticed this on my first ride so there was no returning the helmet.  Love: the internal visor feature, the matte black color, the lightness, the easy strap removal clip, Revzilla customer service.  Decent noise level but I still use earplugs.  I'll try to find a way to get the strap moved forward - this could just be my issue PSA when trying on helmets.\n",

      "A god send for people with big heads - true Long Oval\n",
      "Let me start by saying I have a very large head (at least a size 8 for fitted hats). My head shape is definitely long oval so I was a bit worried when the video said it might be more of an intermediate oval, as I was certain I needed a long oval shell. I ordered this item in 3XL matte black and I couldn't be happier. I spent last season (my first) with a half helmet and wanted something with more protection but had limited options bc of my head size. The positives: True long oval shape, fits my big head perfectly. Might be slightly on the snug side but I've worn it for over and hour at a time with no issues. Fits great, true to description. This is my first full helmet and I'm more of a cruiser but let me say at this price point this helmet is awesome. Good finish and quality, I love the new style chin strap, visor is quality and locks easily. People used to expensive top shelf helmets might disagree but if you want a quality item that looks good and won't empty your pockets this is the way to go. I've received several compliments on my, for $200 it's a bargain. As I said I'm more of a cruiser (top speeds 65 mph), but the helmet does a good job blocking wind noise. With the visor down wind noise is severely reduced but you can still hear the rumble of the engine. The negatives: I didn't think I would be a fan of the drop down tinted sun screen but honestly I love the look of the helmet when the screen is in the down position. Unfortunately with the nose cut out wind gets sucked directly into your eyes when the screen is down. Glasses are a must because of this if you want to ride with the sun screen down and visor up as the wind will make your eyes water quickly. The quality and function is good but don't discard your glasses bc they will be needed if you want to drop the screen but keep the shield up. Peripheral vision isn't as good when changing lanes and looking over my shoulder compared to my half helmet, but this is the only advantage my half helmet has.  I feel like I need to turn my head further to check my blind spots but I'm ok with that. Overall this is a fantastic helmet for the price point. Again I'm a cruiser and have never had a full helmet before but for an entry level full face helmet this would be hard to beat at this price. Would absolutely buy again and would recommend.  Thank you Revzilla for another fast, easy, transaction and for stocking quality items like this one.\n",

      "Great Value for your Money... BUT\n",
      "There's a lot to like about this helmet. It's pretty feature packed for the price point. There are some compromises though. The fit and finish are good, but not great. If you've tried on an Arai helmet, for example, the interior is very plush and the seams on the shell feel really precise. On this LS2 the fit between the styrofoam and the outer shell feels a little sloppy and the pads aren't as cushy as some premium helmets. But again, for the price point the fit and finish are good.The features are also good, with two exceptions. The good bits are the easy release cheek pads, the eye-glass compatible temples, the easy to use drop visor, and the glove-friendly vent controls. The chin vent is a bit poorly made: the toggle has popped off once or twice, but is easily reinstalled. The helmet would also benefit from another vent or two (it can get a little clammy in there if you're sitting in traffic). The other issue is with the pinlock system. Comparing an Arai pinlock system to the LS2 version is like comparing apples to piles of excrement shaped like apples. It doesn't work at all. There's no seal between the pinlock insert and the main visor. Anti-fog coatings and spray-ons are more effective than this BS.The shape of these helmets are long oval and I feel LS2 does a good job of advertising that fact. If you struggle to find helmets that don't leave a pressure point on your forehead, or have too much space at the temples, give this a shot.Overall I'm pleased with the cost to feature ratio. I'd recommend the helmet to anyone with a long oval shaped head that doesn't want to shell out big bucks for a top tier lid.\n",

That being said, the first time I wore it was for a 9 hour ride and although my forehead was a bit sore after that, it has been a perfect fit ever since. The ventilation is quite good and I love the drop down visor. The removable washable padding is great too - nothing worse than sticking your head into a funky helmet. It is a bit of a \"loud\" helmet but not too bad. I installed an intercom system and although it's pretty useless for music on the highway I can hear a spoken voice clearly. And I am told that there is very little wind noise on the mic. I'm not sure how I'd like the flat black in the sun, but I have a white one and it keeps pretty comfortable even on bright sunny days.\n",

      "I am a fairly large guy with a fairly large head. Ive never been able to find a hat to fit me, so deciding that I wanted to start riding this year had me concerned about finding a helmet. The first helmet I ordered (GMax) was not even close to the shape of my head. After consulting with a GearGeek, this helmet was recommended. At first, the helmet was very snug. This was either due to the break in process or just me not being used to wearing a helmet, so its difficult for me to pass judgement. After three months now though, this helmet is an amazing fit. The airflow is excellent and the integrated shades come in handy on my rides. If you are someone with a long oval shaped head, I recommend giving this helmet a shot. It's well worth what I paid. Revzilla's well known fast shipping sure doesn't hurt the cause either.\n",

      "I bought this helmet to replace my years-old G-Max. I wanted a drop-down visor and a long oval shape.The helmet fits a little large, i purchased a medium based on my head measurements and previous fittings from other brand helmets. It allows for a little extra movement then I am used to, but i am confident that a small would not fit at all.As the other reviews note, the chin strap sits a little far back, and tends to pull back on the throat a bit rather than up under my chin.The FFS system is not perfect, but it is a fair improvement over not having an insert at all.The strange thing about this helmet is that I get an air current up under the neck roll and around the back of my right ear, not sure why this happens, and it does not happen on the left side. I am keeping this helmet and am happy with my purchase because it is still a significant improvement over my last helmet.The vents are easy to find and move with gloves on, and they provide great air flow when opened.This helmet is a bit louder than I had hoped it would be, but I am willing to hear a bit more road noise and have a helmet that looks this great and protects my head.I fitted a Sena SMH10, and the microphone boom is only a little bit too short. This is due to a farther back mounting than normal to accommodate for the sun visor slide release.I am overall very happy with this helmet, and am willing to deal with the shortcomings given the styling and overall protection/fit improvement from my previous helmet.\n",

      "I am in the hunt for a new helmet to replace my old Shark RSI. I was looking for a long oval helmet at a good price range. Unfortunately, I feel like you get what you pay for with this helmet. Measuring my head at a little over 57cm, I ordered this helmet in a medium. When I put it on, I could almost turn it 45° on my head. Definitely not the comfortable snug fit I had with the RSI. The quick release strap is a cool function, extremely easy to use, but was incredibly uncomfortable and would dig into my neck. I'm new the the whole internal sun visor thing so this might just be me, but I noticed it would fog way too easily. It also wouldn't drop down all the way and I could see quite a bit under the visor which seemed like wearing sunglasses only covering the top half of my eyes. Maybe that's normal? The external visor itself seemed flimsy and the hardware didn't feel very solid as I'd hope but maybe that's what you get for the price. The vents seemed to work ok, I didn't put them to use but they were easy to find and open/close. The design, paint and finish of the helmet looked great. It felt very light, about the same as my RSI and that's with it having the internal sun visor. I purchased this helmet because I'm on a budget and thought I would give LS2 a chance. I know they are manufactured in China because they tell you and seem proud of it. I liked how they, unlike many other brands, are open about where they are made and even have a video inside showing their process. I also like that they are ISO-9001 certified as I come from a business who follows the same practice and I know what it means as far as strict quality standards. With that all aside, unfortunately, the Vector was not the helmet for me.\n",

      "One of the most beautiful helmets I've ever owned. A quality level of a much more expensive helmet. Still to early to tell about noise level, and comfort, but all my Scorpion helmets in the past have been about average as far as noise goes, but top notch on comfort. This particular model has speaker pockets for communication installation, but they are just atad too small for the new JBL speakers in the Packtalk Bold by Cardo. Will update with more info in the future.\n",

      "This helmet is pretty sweet. For the $500-$600 range, it is a bit pricey.. but the premium you are paying for is the actual Iron Man graphic with \"Marvel\" and \"Stark Industries\" stamped right on the helmet. If all you are looking for is an entry-level helmet HJC makes the IS-17 Iron Man helmet as well. But let me just say that if you have the $$, this helmet will not disappoint. The interior drop down visor is really nice and well made. It clicks into place when not being used, so railroad tracks or other harsh terrain won't drop it accidentally while riding. This helmet comes with five different ventilation areas, three on top of the head, and two in front of the mouth. In addition, it also comes with a built in breath deflector.It does not come with the reflective gold face shield, but let me tell you that it is definitely worth the extra $$ if you can afford it. This helmet gets a LOT of attention, and that extra touch with the gold face shield takes this helmet to a new level.Pros: Lightweight, Pretty sold FoV, Good ventilation, Perfect fit, Interior visor IS even usable while wearing prescription glasses, and above all else.. LOOKS completely badass while still giving all of the protection needed from a motorcycle helmet.Cons: Faceshield lock does not work well, it is clunky to use with motorcycle gloves on.. and with a tad bit of force can even be opened regardless of the lock being applied. For the price, you would also expect a helmet like this to come with built-in bluetooth capabilities.. however, it does not.I would give this helmet a 9/10. If the price were to come down OR if the helmet came with built-in bluetooth at its current price point.. would be a 10/10.\n",

      "Amazing Air Flow\n",
      "In the first 300 feet on the main road, I thought I had the visor open. This helmet flows an incredible amount of air through that chin vent--think of having the visor cracked up 2MM or more. You can actually feel a breeze across your chin and mouth. In fact, it flows so much, that I normally ride with my visor open below 50mph because I love the wind in my face and I can actually put this one down--and I get that feeling at all speeds now. I am beyond impressed.Fit--I returned an RPHA 70 because it was too short for my head, this one is longer so keep that in mind. It fits about like my Shoei GT Air. Comfort--I wore it about 10 minutes in my office, then wore it 25 minutes home, then took it in a 9 hour 275 mile all day cruise through the country. It was awesome, fit perfectly from the first minute. Very soft liner, it was comfy all day. Noise--yeah, the one negative. This helmet is definitely louder than the Shoe GT Air and Scorpion 500 and Icon Alliance. I think it is because it is lighter, and just does not deaden the air noise. It's not bike noise, it's wind noise along the edges, maybe where the shield meets. It's not objectionable, and it does not whistle, it's just a bit louder. I'm still super impressed though; I wear earplugs 100% of the time so it's fine. Dropdown visor--it's OK, it could go down further. On the Ninja 650, it's OK because I am slightly bent over. On the Raider, it's a bit high because I am more upright. It's no worse than others, just not class leading. Quality--I can tell this is a very well built helmet. It's light but strong, feels secure. Definitely my new long ride helmet. Overall, well worth the money--esp since it's $200 less than my Shoei! I will buy this level of AGV again.\n",

The drop down sun visor did not immediately drop upon gently pulling on the latch, so I removed the helmet, read the manual to ensure I wasn't missing anything. I tried again, and the little plastic latch broke. I now see other reviews noting the same failure. I returned and will probably order and EXO-710 with an extra shield.\n",

Sized it based on size chart and fit seems perfect after a couple weeks. Snug (but you want snug) although not tight or uncomfortable. Seems to be breaking in nicely. Not the easiest to get you glasses back on, but not pinching once you get them on. Wish all manufacturers would have a more defined channel for glasses wearers. I have a big melon and the XL was what size chart suggested and what I purchased. As stated earlier, I don't think I would want it any smaller or bigger,\n",

      "II love the look of this helmet.  It fits well, I like the graphics on it, gives plenty of ventilation.  My huge problem is, the drop down interior sun visor.  The mechanism is cheaply made, and you can tell when you pull the lever up and down.  Mine finally stopped moving up and down.  You have to manually pull the visor down and up.  For a $200 helmet, you would expect this visor to last more than 3 months.  I've contacted Scorpion to see what they say.  If they replace the helmet, the new helmet will probably do the same thing.  I have older HJC's and Vega helmets that I've never had any issues with.  Very disappointing.\n",

      "This is my first helmet, so I have nothing to compare it to. I've ridden with it for 4 months now, and I'm very happy with it. Build quality is great, the ventilation in Florida heat is great, and it isn't overly noisy. At 65 mph I can hear wind wooshing by a bit, but no whistling or orher sounds. After an hour or two hour ride, I don't feel any ear fatigue, ear ringing or anything like that.  It keeps my head cool in the summer, and it has mostly kept it warm in 40F temps. Cold air does catch my chin, however, so in sub-50F temps I wear a balaclava. The drop down sun visor mechanism works well, and the faceshield mounting makes it real easy to remove for thorough cleaning. The only feature that I wish it had is maybe a pinlock visor. Cold, humid mornings make for easy fogging when at a standstill or in stop & go traffic.  I would buy this again, and in fact I may.\n",

Totally disappointed with this company, because I ordered Scorpion 950 in first place as an upgrade and have to return it, too heavy, hot and noisy for city commuting, replaced my order with EXO510, it is lighter but this is only good about it, the rest - fit, usage, noise level are terrible.

I did not get any whistling at all, but it only reduces noise levels by an average amount.The drop down visor is great and is adjustable if you want to reduce the distance it drops down.For the money, you really will be hard pressed to find a helmet of this quality with this feature set. It's a very comfortable helmet.The ONLY thing I had an issue with was the mechanism that controls the lock/city vent. It may just be the helmet that I got, but the mechanism just wont work with one thumb like the one on my EXO-R410 did. I have to reach up and twist this thing like a key to make it move and even then it doesn't always work. It is also the only piece of the helmet that feels cheap and flimsy.

The flip down smoke visor is just enough to keep the sun from bothering you but not enough to be too dark in low light. Sun glasses were too tight for my preference. Face shield holds snug to the helmet and creates a strong seal against the gasket. The air channels and vents work well. It has cut outs beneath the internal padding for the circular speakers that come with Bluetooth systems. I couldnt be happier with this helmet.

      "I've been in touch with AGV since trying one of these on in a showroom 5 months ago. I found what the other reviewers said to be true. The strap was placed wrong and felt like it was choking me. The AGV rep said that they were aware of the complaints at that a fix was in the works.He was correct! The new 2019's have a MUCH improved strap placement. I find it now to be a very comfortable and well placed strap. Unfortunately you can only be assured that the 3 new color options are 2019 as the others may be 2018 old stock.I chose the Carbon Refractive and I love it! Firstly, this helmet is even more beautiful in person than the pictures give credit, and its LIGHT (for a modular).My first ride with this helmet reinforced that I had made the right decision. This is the high end Swiss Army knife of helmets. Gone are the days of debating whether I take my 3/4 for the country roads or my full face for safety on the way to the country roads. This plays both roles very well. Perhaps not as well as the best dedicated helmets available in each category, but VERY well!I found the opening mechanism to operate very easily with lightly gloved hands. I also found open face mode to be surprisingly aerodynamic up to around 60mph facing forward. The wind obviously will catch that big duck bill when side facing at high speeds but you cant expect otherwise. On the other hand the helmet is so light and well balanced that the duck bill does next to nothing in terms of unbalancing the feel of the helmet on the head.The other feature I like about open face mode is the drop down sun visor. It lowers to the point of providing half face protection. I enjoyed riding with the helmet in open face mode and sun visor down very much.Closing the lid took a bit of pressure although I've read that it breaks in over time. I find closed mode to be very comfortable with great ventilation and great visibility! Noise level was on par with my last mid-level full face helmet. I would like to see some reviews from independent testing sources on this for comps. I'm sure there are a few quieter helmets out there but this helmet was perfectly fine for all that it brings to the table.I agree with someone’s comment that the lock tab on the visor protrudes into your vision a bit when the visor is fully opened but I think painting it white or silver may help, plus I really don’t think I’ll be riding like that often. I’ll most likely be riding with the helmet in open face mode if I want that much wind in my face. Just my opinion.Bottom line: I LOVE this helmet! This is by far the best helmet I have ever owned! Light and agile for all of my biking needs! As good as it gets for all that it provides\n",

      "My previous full face helmets were Arai and Shoei, then I decided to try a 3/4 HJC FG-Jet helmet and had to sell it because it was very comfortable but also very loud. I bought a Shoei Quest in size L and it did not fit my head no matter what cheek pads I tried, then I bought Shoei RF-SR and it was kinda OK comfortable but still not 100%. Finally I bought this HJC i 70 in size L and it was almost what I wanted except it was slightly too snug all over. I ordered size XL based on some reviews here and it was a perfect match with my head. Pretty snug and comfortable and the price that fit me, too. Thank you, HJC, thank you, RevzillaI My advice to you - buy a next size up if you are in between two sizes.\n",

      "This helmet fit true to measurement.  The first time out I rode 130 miles in 80 degree temps.  There were no pinch points, hot spots with the helmet.  Cheek pads are tight.  Air flow may be a little wanting, but the helmet is light.  I switched from a half-helmet to this full face and found less turbulence around my head with this helmet.  I always wear ear protection when I ride so I can't really comment on the noise level.  The internal drop-down shield is fantastic.  I wear glasses when I ride and the shield wasn't even close to making contact with them.  The glasses cutaway inside the helmet is also a great feature.  I would buy this helmet again.\n",

      "This is the first street helmet ive owned and I love it. Super comfortable and has an amazing look to it. Has a nice wide view and the drop down shade shield is awesome, did not want to have to keep switching shields. Great airflow as I live in AZ and its over 100 right now im not getting super sweaty or gross in it. As for the noise level for me its pretty quiet but ill add I ride a Honda Grom and dont go on freeways. Helmet is super easy to set up with speakers and mic and comes apart super easy for cleaning. It def fit true for me and I even called them to talk about the helmet to make sure it was a good fit for me, there rep Theo was super helpful and wasnt pushy in anyway. This is a great helmet to get and comes along with a great price. I will be a return customer to HJC and have already made a few purchased from Revzilla as there a solid company to work with.\n",

Added a dark smoke visor. Looks awesome. This rias is sharp. Many compliments on the helmet. I can't help much with sizing. I've always worn a XL in hjc and this one is the same.
